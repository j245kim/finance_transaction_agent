Our Industry
We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948
 improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller
 more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.
Computing and Graphics
Computing and Graphics Markets
Central Processing Unit (CPU)
. A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system
 acting as the “brain” of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms
 such as desktop PCs
 notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle)
 clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates
 measured in units of gigahertz
 or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture
 the number and type of cores
 the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple
2
2
""
""
instructions simultaneously
 the bit size of its instruction set
 memory size and data access speed.
Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications
 multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores
 each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology
 which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems
 enables smaller and more portable form factors
 and can lower the total cost of ownership.
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images
 animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards
 as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard
 or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory
 while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.
GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display
 decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU
 the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (e.g. virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).
In addition to graphics processing
 GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing
 deep learning
 artificial and machine intelligence
 blockchain and various other applications (e.g.
 cryptocurrency mining and autonomous driving).
Accelerated Processing Unit (APU).
Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience
 system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices
 with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements.
An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon)
 along with
 in some cases
 other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks to the best-suited component (i.e.
 the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use
 increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by
 for example
 eliminating connections between discrete chips.
System-on-Chip (SoC)
. An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU
 GPU and other components
 such as a memory controller and peripheral management
 comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements as an SoC
 system performance and energy efficiency is improved
 similar to an APU.
Chipset.
A chipset is a generic term referring to a device or a collection of devices that allow the microprocessor to connect to a wider range of peripheral devices in the system (such as storage
 optical drives
 and Universal Serial Bus (USB) peripherals). Chipsets can perform essential logic functions
 and operate in concert with the microprocessor to manage system control and power management functions of all the devices in the system. Chipsets are most often found in larger form factor systems
 typically desktop systems or larger notebook platforms
 which require the expanded peripheral selection that is enabled by the chipset. Typical notebook platforms and small form factor desktop platforms typically do not utilize a chipset and instead rely on the capabilities of the APU to connect to all the required devices on the platform.
Our Computing and Graphics Products
Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms
 which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing components. We believe that integrated
 balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors
 chipsets (either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability
 increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition
 we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU
 a discrete GPU
 and a chipset when needed)
 as we are able to optimize interoperability
 provide our customers a single point of contact for the
3
3
""
""
key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market quickly in a variety of PC and server system form factors.
We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and the AMD Infinity Fabric
 which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die
 and each core has its own dedicated cache
 which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die
 permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2
 or second-level cache
 and L3
 or third-level cache
 to enable fast data access and high performance.
We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end
 we offer CPUs
 GPUs
 APUs
 SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent
 dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently
 enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state.

Graphics Market
The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices. Many consumers value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience
 and
 for these consumers
 the PC has evolved from a traditional data processing and communications device to an entertainment platform. As a result
 visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to increasing creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for computing devices
 including playing games
 capturing media content
 viewing online videos
 editing photos and managing digital content. In turn
 these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Industries that utilize computer assisted design (CAD)
 that develop content for media and entertainment markets and that generate professional visualizations and renderings can benefit greatly from graphics solutions optimized for the professional graphics market.
""
""
In addition to traditional graphics markets
 there is a large and growing market for accelerated computing
 powered by graphics processors
 which is primarily made up of high-performance computing and machine learning/deep learning. Traditional high performance computing focuses on scientific research
 model simulation
 and exploration which is mainly driven by a need for computing throughput in universities and government research centers. The second market is the rapidly growing area of machine learning and deep learning workloads. Graphics processors are used both in the training of machine learning models as well as the application of models via inference. The expansion of compute workloads on graphics processors is driving market expansion for traditional graphics silicon.
""
Another area of the market for graphics compute is blockchain technology
 which is a decentralized digital ledger used to securely store
 transmit and process sensitive and valuable data. Blockchain applications are typically performed using specifically designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or a general purpose CPU or GPU.
Our Graphics Products
Graphics processing is a fundamental component of almost everything we create and can be found in an APU
 GPU
 SoC or a combination of a discrete GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem. Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to enable or increase the speed of rendering images
 to help improve image resolution and color definition
 and increasingly to process massive data sets for cloud and data center applications. We develop our graphics products for use in various computing devices and entertainment platforms

Our APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip
 while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dGPUs) offer high performance graphics processing across all platforms. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs
 working in concert with the CPU
 to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU processing by utilizing the vast number of discrete GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively. In addition
 computing devices with heterogeneous computing features can run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently
 which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user. Moreover
 heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level as the CPU for memory access
 queuing and execution.

graphics is our product brand for the embedded graphics market. Our product brand for professional graphics products are AMD Radeon Pro AMD FirePro™ graphics; our product brand for data center graphics is Radeon Instinct™ accelerators for servers. We also market and sell our chipsets under AMD trademarks.
We market our products through direct marketing and co-marketing programs. In addition
 we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers and third parties
 including market development programs
 pursuant to which we may provide product information
 training
 marketing materials and funds. Under our co-marketing development programs
 eligible customers can use market development funds as reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products and third-party systems integrating our products
 subject to meeting defined criteria.
Customers
Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
 large direct data centers
 original design manufacturers (ODMs)
 system integrators and independent distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers
 OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs). Large direct data centers consist of cloud service providers.
Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs
 often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers
 who build the OEM motherboards
 as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.
We work closely with our customers to define product features
 performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing
 testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.
We also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU
 GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.
Our major customer
 Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC
 accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended
December 28
 2019
. Sales to
Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC
consisted of products from our Enterprise
 Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Original Equipment Manufacturers
We focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals
 selected regional accounts and some local system integrators
 who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations
 desktops
 notebooks
 PC motherboards and game consoles.
Third-Party Distributors
Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically
 distributors handle a wide variety of products
 and may include those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances
 our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition
 some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.
Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators
We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs)
 retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.

Competition in the Microprocessor and Chipset Market
Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share
 margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively
 to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.
Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market
 Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform
 which includes core logic chipsets
 graphics chips
 networking devices (wired and wireless)
 non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel
 which can make them less innovative on their own and
 to a large extent
 can become distributors of Intel technology. Additionally
 Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.
As long as Intel remains in this dominant position
 we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: business practices
 including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions which may limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling
 marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers
 retailers and channel partners that require or result in exclusive product arrangements; de facto control over industry standards
 and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants
 including motherboard
 memory
 chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers and retailers.
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing
 research and development
 new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.
Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage
 including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market
 such as Nvidia Corporation
 preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also
 Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market
 its introduction of competitive new products
 its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARM-based designs at relatively low cost and low power processors for the computing market including tablets and thin-client form factors
 as well as dense servers
 set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM cores and architecture to third parties
 including us
 and offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient
 high-performing products at an attractive price point.
Competition in the Graphics Markets
In the graphics market
 our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics
 embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets
 and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components
 particularly for notebooks
 because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users
 at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market
 such as Nvidia Corporation
 preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also
 Intel is developing its own high-end discrete GPUs for both consumer and commercial applications.
Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia and they are considered the market share leader. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies
 which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs
 but less financial resources to do so
 especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

In the data center
 our principal competitor is Nvidia as the adoption of their proprietary CUDA software platform established their market share in high performance computing and machine learning. Other competitors include numerous deep learning accelerator companies
 consisting mostly of early to late stage start-ups.
We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products
 where graphics performance is critical
 and where we compete primarily against Nvidia.
Competition in the Server Markets
In the server market
 we compete against Intel with our CPU server products and Nvidia with our GPU server products.
Research and Development
We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP
 and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products
 with
 in each case
 improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example
 we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets
 including commercial clients
 mobile computing and gaming. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology
 software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Canada
 China
 India
 Taiwan and Singapore who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.
Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities
Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities
GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc
.
We are a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF)
 which governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA
 we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements
 and a certain portion of our GPU products
 from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm
 with limited exceptions. GF was a related party to us until May 15
 2019.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
. We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of wafers for certain products.
Other Third-Party Manufacturers
. We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.
Assembly
 Test
 Mark and Packaging Facilities
Wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly
 test
 mark and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two assembly
 test
 mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively
 the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co.
 Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs.
Intellectual Property and Licensing
We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights
 patents
 patent applications
 trademarks
 trade secrets and mask work rights. As of
December 28
 2019
""
 we had approximately 4
000 patents in the United States and approximately 900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases
 we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters
 we have approximately 9
900 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 7
200 issued patents and 2
800 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions
 as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent
 or the expiration of any patent
 is or would be material to our business.
As is typical in the semiconductor industry
 we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross-license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11
 2009. Under the cross-license
10
10
""
""
agreement
 we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us
 non-exclusive
 royalty-free licenses to all of each other’s patents that were first filed no later than November 11
 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products. Under the cross-license agreement
 Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties
 but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross-license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents
 unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross-license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross-license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination
 the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue
 subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross-license agreement. The cross-license agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross-license agreement)
 and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party
 that party may assume
 but may not assign
 the cross-license agreement
 and in the event that the cross-license agreement cannot be assumed
 the cross-license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate.
Backlog
Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally
 in light of current industry practice
 we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products
 our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter.
""
Seasonality
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically
 our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year
 although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.
Employees
As of
December 28
 2019
""
 we had approximately 11
400 employees.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations
 including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes
 discharge of pollutants into the environment
 the treatment
 transport
 storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products
 including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance
 we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws
 regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them
 a range of consequences could result
 including fines
 suspension of production
 alteration of manufacturing processes
 import/export restrictions
 sales limitations
 criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used
 stored
 released
 disposed of by us or located at
 under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures
 we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore
 we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws
 and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of
 or exposure to
 hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Environmental laws are complex
 change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example
 the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world
 there is a risk that the cost
 quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions
 may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions
 or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps
 or produce sudden changes in demand
 which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU
 Australia
 California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.

Certain environmental laws
 including the U.S. Comprehensive
 Environmental Response
 Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
 or the Superfund Act
 impose strict or
 under certain circumstances
 joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of
 or was not responsible for
 the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility.
We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale
 California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981
 we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.
In 1991
 we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements
 other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.
To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders
 we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability
 if any
 in excess of amounts already accrued
 will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 cash flows or results of operations.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition
 you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously.
Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.
Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share
 margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively
 to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.
Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market
 Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform
 which includes core logic chipsets
 graphics chips
 networking devices (wired and wireless)
 non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally
 Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing
 research and development
 new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies
 or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do
 we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
As long as Intel remains in this dominant position
 we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices
 including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions
 designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling
 marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers
 retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards
 and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants
 including motherboard
 memory
 chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer OEM customers and retailers.
Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage
 including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market
 such as Nvidia Corporation
 preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also
 Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market
 its introduction of competitive new products
 its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs
 and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.
We rely on third parties to manufacture our products
 and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
We rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble
 test
 mark and pack (ATMP) our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.
We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers
 we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers
 which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition
 if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers
 it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly
 we depend on these suppliers to
13
13
""
""
allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs
 to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies
 including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers
 increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance
 lack of capacity in periods of excess demand
 misappropriation of our intellectual property
 dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover
 if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities
 lose benefits under material agreements
 experience power outages
 lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products
 encounter financial difficulties
 are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency
 we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products
 our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.
If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers
 we may experience delayed product introductions
 lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer
 or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers
 we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively
 the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co.
 Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs
 it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.
Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology
 which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer
 and low yields can result from design failures
 process technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions
 errors or difficulties during production
 we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop
 obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies
 products or processes earlier.  Moreover
 during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies
 their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us
 particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example
 we are presently focusing our 7 nanometer (nm) product portfolio on Taiwan Semiconductor Co.
 Ltd.’s (TSMC) 7nm process. If  TSMC is not able to manufacture our 7nm products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs
 which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers
 which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.
The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development
 qualification
 implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop
 qualify and distribute
 and have manufactured
 new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements
 at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market
 PC sales could be negatively impacted
 which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next generation AMD Ryzen™
 AMD Radeon™ and AMD EPYC™ processors using 7nm+ process technology. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing
 qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly
 we may lose competitive positioning
 which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our
14
14
""
""
products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development
 we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop
 obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover
 our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue
 may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful
 will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation
 financial condition and operating results.
Delays in developing
 qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or
 in some cases
 breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products
 they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users
 which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products
 it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users
 which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition
 market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product
 the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing
 we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing
 if necessary. Our research and development expenditures
 together with ongoing operating expenses
 will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors
 technological advances by existing competitors
 or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts
 our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue
 our operating results could decline.
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities
 including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or
 if available
 may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers
 who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects
 our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.
We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products
 or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products
 our business would be materially adversely affected.
Our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products.
The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result
 our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline
 our customers’ desire to pursue the project
 and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customer’s products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover
 we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties
 and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently
 the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our
15

operating results may be adversely affected.
Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.
Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business
 including
 without limitation
 a slowdown in the Chinese economy
 one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition
 during challenging economic times
 our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify
 delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally
 if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing
 they may not be able to pay
 or may delay payment of
 accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers’ potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover
 our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent
 thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition
 uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.
Our worldwide operations are subject to political
 legal and economic risks and natural disasters
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.
We maintain operations around the world
 including in the United States
 Canada
 Europe
 Australia and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States
 Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities
 operated by third-party manufacturing facilities
 in China
 Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales
 as a percent of net revenue
 were 74% for the year ended December 28
 2019. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.
The political
 legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include
 without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws
 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations
 including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
In addition
 our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes
 tsunamis
 flooding
 typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example
 our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate
 including public health issues (for example
 an outbreak of a contagious disease such as 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
 avian influenza
 measles or Ebola)
 safety issues
 natural disasters
 fire
 disruptions of service from utilities
 nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example
 the United Kingdom’s 2016 referendum
 commonly referred to as “Brexit
” has created economic and political uncertainty in the European Union. Also
 the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant new requirements on how we collect
 process and transfer personal data
 as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks
 should they occur
 could result in an increase in the cost of components
 production delays
 general business interruptions
 delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology
 tariffs and other barriers and restrictions
 longer payment cycles
 increased taxes
 restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws
 any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
Government actions and regulations such as export administration regulations
 tariffs
 and trade protection measures
 may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.
We have a joint venture with Higon Information Technology Co.
 Ltd. (THATIC)
 comprised of two separate legal entities
 China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively
 the THATIC JV). In June 2019
 the United States Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List
 including THATIC and the THATIC JV. In October 2019
 the BIS added additional Chinese entities to the Entity List. Also
 the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. Specifically
 United States-China trade relations remain uncertain. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin
 and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the United States. We are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs
 trade protection measures
 import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States
 China or other

countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs
 trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business.
Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.
The products that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in
 among other things
 the loss
 corruption
 theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance
 be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may also depend on third parties
 such as customers
 vendors and end users
 to deploy our mitigations or create their own
 and they may delay
 decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products
 reduce or delay future purchases of our products
 or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We also are subject to claims and litigation related to Spectre side-channel exploits and may face additional claims or litigation for future vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity
 damage to our brand and reputation
 and could materially harm our business or financial results.
IT outages
 data loss
 data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information
 be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business
 reputation and operations.
In the ordinary course of our business
 we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets
 and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets
 including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents
 cyber-attacks
 hacking and phishing attacks
 business and system disruption attacks
 and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources
 all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic
 or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect
 defend against or prevent. Our network and storage applications
 as well as those of our customers
 business partners
 and third-party providers
 may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error
 malfeasance or other system disruptions.
It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access
 misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers
 business partners or third party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs
 result in product development delays
 disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability
 expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.
We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information.
We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to: enhancing and implementing information security controls
 including costs related to upgrading application
 computer
 and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and compliance with external regulations
 such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act.
We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However
 if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices
 or in the event of a breach of their networks
 our workers’ data may be improperly accessed
 used or disclosed.
A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information
 IT outages
 data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition
 our competitive position and operating results.

We have a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and accelerated processing unit (APU) product requirements and a certain portion of our graphics processing unit (GPU) product requirements manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer from GF
 with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements
 our business could be adversely impacted.
The wafer supply agreement (WSA) governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and is in place until 2024. Pursuant to the WSA
 we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm)
 with limited exceptions. If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields
 manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements
 then we may experience supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected.
Under the terms of the WSA
 we have agreed to minimum annual wafer purchase targets through 2021. If we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year
 we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target
 we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs
 both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.
In addition
 GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) for its funding needs. If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis
 or at all
 and if GF is not otherwise able to adequately fund its operations
 GF’s ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected.
Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.
We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally
 our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products
 which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers
 as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel.
PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles
 which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition
 our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth
 and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory
 which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins.
Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory
 which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory
 a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products
 including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.
Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition
 our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example
 historically
 our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year
 although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.
The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Facility impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
The indenture governing our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) contains various covenants which limit our ability to
 among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments
 including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from sales of assets; enter
18
18
""
""
into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety.
In addition
 the Secured Revolving Facility’s credit agreement (Credit Agreement) restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that (i) on the date of such payment
 an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement or would result therefrom or (ii) if we would have
 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment
 a consolidated total leverage ratio that exceeds 3.50x. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. If under certain circumstances we fail to make a cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture
 it would constitute an event of default under such indenture
 which
 in turn
 could constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness.
Our Secured Revolving Facility also contains various covenants which limit our ability to
 among other things
 incur additional indebtedness and liens
 make certain investments
 merge or consolidate with other entities
 make certain dispositions
 create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments
 make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date and enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate (in each case
 except for certain customary exceptions).
The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Facility contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other indebtedness. For example
 the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes)
 and (ii) $100 million would cause a cross default under the Secured Revolving Facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Facility to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.50% Notes or 2.125% Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings
 we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.
The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.
The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions
 product quality
 product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences)
 energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life)
 reliability
 processor clock speed
 performance
 size (or form factor)
 selling price
 cost
 adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards)
 level of integration
 software and hardware compatibility
 security and stability
 brand recognition and availability.
We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes
 frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors
 especially during challenging economic times. In addition
 our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market
 leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies
 including interface
 processor and memory technical information. For instance
 with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics
 we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us
 demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition
 Intel has announced that it plans to expand its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments
 which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments.
In addition
 we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts
 or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also
 the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers
 customers and partners in the industry.

The conversion of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders
 or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
The conversion of some or all of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The 2.125% Notes will mature on September 1
 2026
 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted. During the fourth quarter of 2019
 the sale price for conversion was satisfied as of the end of December 31
 2019 and as a result
 the 2.125% Notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2020. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition
 the existence of the 2.125% Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions
 or the anticipated conversion of the 2.125% Notes into cash and/or shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments
 which have in the past experienced a decline driven by
 among other factors
 the adoption of smaller and other form factors
 increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions
 including the success of the Sony PlayStation®4
 Sony PlayStation®4 Pro
 Microsoft® Xbox One™ S and Microsoft® Xbox One™ X game console systems worldwide. In addition
 the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example
 our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example
 China and South Korea have instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and the valuations of the currencies
 and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market
 our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.
In the design and development of new and enhanced products
 we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore
 certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable
 is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
We depend on third-party companies for the design
 manufacture and supply of motherboards
 software
 memory and other computer platform components to support our business.
We depend on third-party companies for the design
 manufacture and supply of motherboards
 graphics cards
 software (e.g. BIOS
 operating systems
 drivers)
 memory and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor
 GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on our add-in-board (AIB) partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition
 our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers
 manufacturers
 AIBs and suppliers of motherboards
 graphics cards
 software
 memory and other components cease or reduce their design
 manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products
 our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products
 we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly
 the success of our products in the market
 such as our APU products
 is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products
 independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition
 some software drivers licensed for use
20
20
""
""
with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver
 or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors
 our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.
Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.
We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us
 decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all
 our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition
 if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
Additionally
 distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances
 our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions
 as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products
 the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.
We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.
We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis
 we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances
 such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results
 changes in management’s business strategy
 an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace
 an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price
 which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.
We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as intangible assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets
 changes in competing technologies
 and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. For example
 during the fourth quarter of 2018
 we recorded an impairment charge in Cost of sales of $45 million on technology licenses related to products that were no longer being used.
Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.
Much of our future success depends upon the continued service our executives of numerous qualified engineering
 marketing
 sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract
 train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business
 the progress of our product development programs could be hindered
 and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract
 retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees
 we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock
 or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit
 our ability to attract
 retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened
 which could harm our results of operations. Also
 if the value of our stock awards increases substantially
 this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition
 any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
Our total debt principal amount as of December 28
 2019 was $0.6 billion. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations
 including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital
 capital expenditures
 acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use
21
21
""
""
our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital
 capital expenditures
 acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.
We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables
 which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons
 and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances
 such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements.
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance
 which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter
 and is subject to prevailing economic
 financial and business conditions along with other factors
 many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds
 including under our secured revolving credit facility for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Secured Revolving Facility)
 in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt
 we may be required to sell assets or equity
 reduce expenditures
 refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt
 sell assets or equity
 borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Facility or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us
 if at all.
In the event of a change of control
 we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Secured Revolving Facility
 which would result in a default under the indentures and our Secured Revolving Facility.
Upon a change of control
 we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof
 plus accrued and unpaid interest
 if any
 up to
 but excluding
 the repurchase date. In addition
 a change of control would be an event of default under our Secured Revolving Facility. As of December 28
 2019
 $0.6 billion principal amount was outstanding under our notes. Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our Secured Revolving Facility.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected
 and may continue to materially adversely affect
 our business in the future.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns
 often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change
 wide fluctuations in supply and demand
 continuous new product introductions
 price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns
 due to: substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels.
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases
 which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been
 and may in the future be
 negatively affected by these downturns.
The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure
 as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations
 sales of our products may decrease
 which would have a material adverse effect on us.
Acquisitions
 joint ventures and/or investments could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Our success will depend
 in part
 on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies
 customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances
 we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses
 solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult
 time-consuming and costly
 and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. Moreover
 if such acquisitions or joint
22
22
""
""
ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing
 we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture
 we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business
 technologies
 solutions
 assets
 personnel or operations
 particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently
 we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results. In addition
 to complete an acquisition
 we may issue equity securities
 which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock
 as well as incur debt
 assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets
 which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses
 which could harm our business. Also
 any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risk of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered.
Furthermore
 we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations
 products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs
 and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs
 it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition
 we may not realize the anticipated benefits from any new business initiatives such as the THATIC JV. We may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance
 the receipt of any future milestone payments and royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019
 the United States Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List
 including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation.
Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business
 processes and internal controls.
We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions
 and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such
 our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.
These changes may also require changes in our information systems
 modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems
 and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners
 may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events
 power anomalies or outages
 natural disasters
 viruses or malware
 cyber-attacks
 data breaches and computer system or network failures
 exposing us to significant cost
 reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.
In addition
 as our IT environment continues to evolve
 we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However
 these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment
 making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users
 and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes
 or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements
 our business would be materially adversely affected.
If essential equipment
 materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products
 we could be materially adversely affected.
We may purchase equipment and materials for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition
 as many of our products increase in technical complexity
 we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers
 or in some cases
 a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors
 including our APU products. Similarly
 certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory
 printed circuit boards (PCBs)
 interposers
 substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are
23
23
""
""
currently available from only a limited number of sources. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex
 it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. From time to time
 suppliers may extend lead times
 limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also
 some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations
 or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products
 our business would be materially adversely affected.
If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware
 we could be materially adversely affected.
Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further
 we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware
 we could be materially adversely affected. In addition
 the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.
Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that
 despite our testing procedures
 errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future
 which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products
 material recall and replacement costs
 loss of revenue
 writing down the inventory of defective products
 the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts
 defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities
 including property damage
 personal injury
 damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property
 and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition
 we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result
 we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.
We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes
 or merely appears to have caused
 an injury
 whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products
 and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim
 recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends
 in part
 on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly
 we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing
 distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business
 expand to high-growth adjacent markets
 acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers
 the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products
 and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations
 our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions
 including portions of our product distribution
 transportation management and information technology support services.
We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities
 to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition
 we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us
 including help desk support
 desktop application services
 business and software support applications
 server and storage administration
 data center operations
 database administration and voice
 video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms
 in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also
 we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed
 in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.

Our stock price is subject to volatility.
Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results
 changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts
 changes in our capital structure
 including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public
 interest rate changes
 news regarding our products or products of our competitors
 and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation
 which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition
 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.
Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.
Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict
 political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable
 and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations
 or adversely affect demand for our products
 and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore
 these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive
 which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets.
Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.
We have costs
 assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence
 movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue
 affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate
 we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flow. In addition
 the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.
Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.
We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time
 our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us
 thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also
 when gray market products enter the market
 we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products
 which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition
 our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products
 including products that may have been altered
 mishandled or damaged
 or are used products represented as new.
If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad
 through patents
 copyrights
 trade secrets
 trademarks and other measures
 we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.
We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts
 including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements
 copyrights
 patents
 trademarks and common law rights
 such as trade secrets
 to protect our intellectual property. However
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged
 invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us.
Furthermore
 patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or
 if a patent is issued
 the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights
 others may independently develop similar products
 duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition
 it is difficult to monitor compliance with
 and enforce
 our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad
 our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised
 and our business would be materially adversely affected.
25

We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.
From time to time
 we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example
 as described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements
 we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers
 which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims
 including those described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements. On occasion
 we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions
 and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us
 including the claims described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements
 it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.
With respect to intellectual property litigation
 from time to time
 we have been notified of
 or third parties may bring or have brought
 actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others
 contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others
 improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted
 we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms
 if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted
 which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages
 including material royalty payments
 or other types of damages
 or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide
 in the alternative
 to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit
 could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.
Even if we were to prevail
 any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities.
We are subject to income tax
 indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Act) contains many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws
 which the consequences of could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future U.S. income tax expense. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as new accounting treatment is clarified
 we may report additional adjustments in the period if new information becomes available. We have a significant amount of deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383
 separate return loss year rules
 or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce the ability of the Company to be able to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes. Tax law changes or the limitations could be material and could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.
In the ordinary course of our business
 there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax
 indirect tax
 or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable
 we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit
 assessment or litigation
 there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
We are subject to environmental laws
 conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations
 including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes
 discharge of pollutants into the environment
 the treatment
 transport
 storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products
 including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance
 we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws
 regulations and permits.
26
26
""
""
If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them
 a range of consequences could result
 including fines
 suspension of production
 alteration of manufacturing processes
 import/export restrictions
 sales limitations
 criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply
 higher sourcing costs
 and/or reputational damage for us.
Environmental laws are complex
 change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example
 the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world
 there is a risk that the cost
 quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions
 or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps
 or produce sudden changes in demand
 which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU
 Australia
 California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.
Certain environmental laws
 including the United States Comprehensive
 Environmental Response
 Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
 or the Superfund Act
 impose strict or
 under certain circumstances
 joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of
 or was not responsible for
 the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale
 California. Although we have not yet been
 we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition
 contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities.
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements
 such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process
 determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products
 auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation
 the European Union
 China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Also
 since our supply chain is complex
 we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover
 we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers
 they may choose a competitor’s products.
The United States federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking. Germany’s federal procurement office
 in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association
 issued new supply chain labor requirements. In addition
 the United Kingdom
 Australia and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers as well as the Responsible Business Alliance have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain
 we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover
 we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product.

We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements
 the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period
 the primary factors that resulted in those changes
 and how certain accounting principles
 policies and estimates affect our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis
 including those related to our revenue
 inventories
 goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations
 the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult
 subjective and complex judgments.
Revenue recognition.
We recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in)
 rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). Accordingly
 we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors.
Revenue Allowances.
We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns
 historical allowances
 historical price reductions
 market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions
 resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.
Inventory Valuation.
At each balance sheet date
 we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition
 we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our actual cost or estimated net realizable value. Among other factors
 management considers recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand
 estimates of future selling prices
 competitiveness of product offerings
 market and industry conditions
 customer requirements and product life cycles when determining excess
 obsolescence and net realizable value in relation to the inventory on hand. If in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates
 additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period
 related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.
Goodwill.
We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and
 if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred
 on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.
Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration
 overall financial performance
 share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. We first analyze qualitative factors. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount
 we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.
If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value
 a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis
 if necessary
 considers the income approach
 which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows
 discount rates
 and future economic and market conditions.
A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Income Taxes
. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes
 we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.

We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%)
 we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance
 we consider multiple factors including past performance
 the reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 tax planning strategies
 and future expected taxable income. When considering all available evidence
 if it is determined we can more-likely-than-not realize our deferred tax assets
 we will reverse the existing valuation allowance
 which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.
In addition
 the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results
 an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense
 respectively.
Results of Operations
We report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise
 Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 15: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II
 Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically
 our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year
 although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.
The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for

Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was
43%
in
2019
compared to
38%
in
2018
. The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors
 which have a higher gross margin than the corporate average.
Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses of
$1.5 billion
in
2019
""
increased
by
$113 million
""
 or
8%
""
 compared to
$1.4 billion
in
2018
. The
increase
was primarily due to an increase in product development costs in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise
 Embedded and Semi-Custom segments as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense.

 Embedded and Semi-Custom segments
 as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense.
Licensing Gain

 we recognized
$60 million
as licensing gain associated with the licensed IP to THATIC JV. See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.

Interest expense of
$94 million
in
2019

Provision For (Benefit From) Income Taxes
We recorded an income tax provision of $31 million in 2019 and income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018.
The income tax provision in
2019
was primarily due to $22 million of withholding taxes related to cross-border transactions and $22 million of foreign income taxes in profitable locations partially offset by a $13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year.
The income tax benefit in
2018
was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010
 offset by $13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act
 $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions.
As we continue to make progress in our business resulting in improved financial results
 our future reassessment could possibly result in a determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. The impact of the determination would result in the release of the valuation allowance and significant financial impact in a future reporting period with a material non-cash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
International Sales
International sales as a percentage of net revenue were
74%
in
2019
and
80%
in
2018
. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Our aggregate principal debt obligations were
$0.6 billion
and
$1.5 billion
as of
December 28
 2019
and
December 29
 2018
""
 respectively.
We believe our cash
 cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our Secured Revolving Facility entered into in June 2019 (refer to Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) will be sufficient to fund operations
 including capital expenditures
 over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However
 we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms
 or at all.
Operating Activities
Net cash
provided by
operating activities was
$493 million
in
2019
compared to net cash
provided by
operating activities of
$34 million
in
2018
. The
increase
in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital
 largely driven by higher cash collections
 partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments and higher wafer purchases and payroll.
Investing Activities
Net cash
used in
investing activities was
$149 million
in 2019
 which primarily consisted of $217 million for purchases of property and equipment
 partially offset by a net cash inflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $41 million.

Net cash
used in
investing activities was
$170 million
in 2018
 which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment and a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $78 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash
provided by
financing activities was
$43 million
in 2019
 which primarily consisted of a cash inflow of $449 million from the warrant exercised by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and $74 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation equity plans
 partially offset by $473 million of cash used for debt reduction activities during the year.
Net cash
provided by
financing activities was
$28 million
in 2018
 which consisted of a net cash inflow of $70 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans
 partially offset by $41 million of cash used for debt reduction activities in 2018.

7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022
On August 15
 2012
 we issued $500 million of the 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The 7.50% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15
 2013 until the maturity date of August 15
 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15
 2012 between us and Wells Fargo Bank
 N.A.
 as trustee.
In 2014
 we repurchased
$25 million
in aggregate principal amount of the
7.50%
Notes in open market transactions for
$24 million
. In 2016
 we repurchased
$125 million

7.50%
Notes pursuant to a partial tender offer for
$135 million
. In 2017

2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026
In September 2016
 we issued
$805 million
in aggregate principal amount of
2.125%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (
2.125%
Notes). The
2.125%
Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year
 commencing in March 2017.
The
2.125%
Notes mature on September 1
 2026. However
 as outlined in the indenture governing the
2.125%
Notes
 holders of the
2.125%
Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances:
(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30
 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter)
 if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of
30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to
130%
of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$8.00
per share of common stock);
(2) during the
five
business day period after any
ten
consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per
$1
000
principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than
98%
of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or
(3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
On or after June 1
 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date
 holders may convert their notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion
 we will pay or deliver
 as the case may be
 cash
 shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election.
The event described in (1) above was met during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019 and
 as a result
 the
2.125%
Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from January 1
 2020 and remain convertible until March 31
 2020.
During 2019
 we converted $554 million principal amount of the 2.125% Notes through the issuance of approximately 69 million shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $8.00 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $56 million. As of
December 28
 2019
""
 we had $251 million principal of 2.125% Notes outstanding.
See Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below for additional information regarding our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes.
Operating Leases
We lease certain of our facilities under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. In addition
 we lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancellable lease obligations as of
December 28
 2019

Interest Rate Risk.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly
 our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of
December 28
 2019
""
 our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short
 weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment
 our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.
As of
December 28
 2019
""
 all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently
 our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.
We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.
Default Risk.
We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.
We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of
December 28
 2019
""
 substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks
 such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.

Foreign Exchange Risk.
As a result of our foreign operations
 we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
 while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
In applying our strategy
 from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. To the extent such hedges are effective
 the gain or loss on these contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and

reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
We also use
 from time to time
 foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly
 the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.
The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of
December 28
 2019
and
December 29
 2018
. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.
