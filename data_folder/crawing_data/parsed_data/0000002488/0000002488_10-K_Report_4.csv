 we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally
 we have increased our focus on global system integrators
 which resell OEM systems
 coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise
 high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations
 desktops
 notebooks
 PC motherboards and game consoles.
Third-Party Distributors
Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs
 ODMs
 and other customers. Typically
 distributors handle a wide variety of products
 and may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances
 our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition
 some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.
Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators
We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs)
 retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.
Competition in Data Center Segment
In Data Center
 we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA
 Adaptive SoC
 CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA) with our CPU
 GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the server market
 which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.
Competition in Client Segment
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel.

Competition in Gaming Segment
In the graphics market
 our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA who is the market share leader. Intel also manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Also
 Intel has developed their own gaming-focused discrete GPUs and has entered the market. Other competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Some of our competitors are smaller companies
 which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs
 but less financial resources to address the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs. With respect to integrated graphics
 higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components
 particularly for notebooks
 because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products
 where graphics performance is critical.
Competition in Embedded Segment
We expect continued competition from our primary FPGA competitors such as Intel
 Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi
 acquired by Microchip)
 from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation
 Marvell Technology Group
 Ltd.
 Analog Devices
 Texas Instruments Incorporated and NXP Semiconductors N.V.
 and from NVIDIA. In addition
 we expect continued competition from the ASIC market
 which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Other competitors include manufacturers of:
""
•
high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;
•
high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;
•
ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;
•
high-speed
 low-density complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs);
•
high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;
•
products with embedded processors;
•
products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers;
•
discrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and
•
other new or emerging programmable logic products
.

 Mark and Packaging Facilities
Wafers for our products are either sorted by the foundry or delivered by the foundry to our assembly
 test
 mark and packaging (ATMP) partners or subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively
 the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co.
 Ltd. The ATMP JVs
 Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. (SPIL) and King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) provide ATMP services for our products.
Intellectual Property and Licensing
We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights
 patents
 patent applications
 trademarks
 trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 31
 2022
 we had approximately 8
200 patents in the United States and approximately 2
200 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases
 we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters
 we have approximately 19
800 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 13
200 issued patents and 6
600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions
 as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent
 or the expiration of any patent
 is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry
 we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products
 including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software
 open-source software
 and related technologies
 such as compilers
 for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend
.
Backlog
Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters
 they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter.
Seasonality
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically
 our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year
 although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.
Human Capital
As of December 31
 2022
 we had approximately 25
000 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation
 creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following:

Environmental Regulations
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations
 including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes
 discharge of pollutants into the environment
 the treatment
 transport
 storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products
 including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Environmental laws are complex
 change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example
 the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. A number of jurisdictions including the EU
 Australia
 California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.

Certain environmental laws
 including the United States Comprehensive
 Environmental Response
 Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
 or the Superfund Act
 impose strict or
 under certain circumstances
 joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of
 or was not responsible for
 the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders forthreesites in Sunnyvale
 California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981
 we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at thesethreesites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.
In 1991
 we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to thethreesites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements
 other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.
To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders
 we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material.

Economic and Strategic Risks
""
Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.
""
Intel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share
 margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively
 to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.
""
Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market
 Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform
 which includes core logic chipsets
 graphics chips
 networking devices (wired and wireless)
 non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally
 Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.
""
As long as Intel remains in this dominant position
 we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices
 including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions
 designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling
 marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers
 retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards
 and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants
 including motherboard
 memory
 chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.
""
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing
 research and development
 new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies
 or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do
 we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
""
Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage
 including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market
 such as NVIDIA Corporation
 preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies. Also
 Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs
 including gaming focused discrete GPUs. We also compete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. Intel’s position in the microprocessor
 and integrated graphics chipset markets
 its introduction of competitive new products
 its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs
 and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.
""
Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.
""
We experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain in the second half of 2022. Uncertain global economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions
 such as inflation
 interest rates or recession
 may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition
 during challenging economic times
 our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify
 delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally
 if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing
 they may not be able to pay
 or may delay payment of
 accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for
16

our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover
 our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent
 thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition
 uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.
""
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected
 and may continue to materially adversely affect
 our business in the future.
""
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns
 often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change
 wide fluctuations in supply and demand
 continuous new product introductions
 price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in previous downturns
 due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels.
""
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases
 which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been
 and may in the future be
 negatively affected by these downturns. In the second half of 2022
 we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.
""
The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure
 as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations
 sales of our products may decrease
 which would have a material adverse effect on us.
""
The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
""
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments
 which in the second half of 2022 experienced a decline as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. In the past
 revenues from the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by
 among other factors
 the adoption of smaller and other form factors
 increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions
 including the success of the Sony PlayStation® 5
 Microsoft® Xbox
TM
Series S and Microsoft® Xbox
TM
Series X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft
 worldwide. In addition
 the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example
 our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example
 China has banned such activities
 and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively
 countries have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market
 our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.
""
The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.
""
We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products
 or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products
 our business would be materially adversely affected.

The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.
""
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures
 including at various times vaccination and testing requirements and recordkeeping
 quarantines
 business closures
 travel bans
 and restrictions related to social gathering and mobility
 to contain the virus. Various state and federal rules are issued and updated on an ongoing basis
 at times in conflict and/or with minimal notice. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business as these changing measures have
 and will continue to have
 an effect on our business operations and practices.
""
While our employees gradually return to office
 we continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Although some public health measures have eased
 our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose our employees to health risks. It is uncertain as to when all health measures put in place to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be lifted. If there are further waves of the virus
 health measures may be reimplemented and we may need to further limit operations or modify our business practices in a manner that may impact our business. If our employees are not able to perform their job duties due to self-isolation
 quarantine
 lockdown measures
 unavailability of COVID 19 tests
 travel restrictions or illness
 a reluctance or refusal to vaccinate
 or are unable to perform them as efficiently at home for an extended period of time
 we may not be able to meet our product schedules
 roadmaps and customer commitments and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our workforce. Even when COVID-19 health measures are lifted or modified
 our employees’ ability or willingness to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumption of normal business operations.
""
COVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers
 logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. We have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 and we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. We have taken efforts to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment
 materials or substrates at a reasonable cost
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19. If the supply of our products to customers is delayed
 reduced or canceled due to disruptions encountered by our third-party manufacturers
 back-end manufacturers
 warehouses
 partners
 suppliers or vendors as a result of facility closures
 border and port restrictions or closures
 transportation delays
 lockdown measures
 labor shortages or workforce mobility limitations

COVID-19 has in the short-term and may in the long-term adversely impact the global economy
 creating uncertainty and potentially leading to an economic downturn. This could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone or cancel purchases
 or delay paying or default on payment of outstanding amounts due to us
 which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Even in times of strong demand for our products
 the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19 and such demand may not be sustainable over the longer term.
""
COVID-19 has also led to a disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets. While we believe our cash
 cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our Revolving Credit Agreement and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations
 including capital expenditures
 and purchase commitments
 over the next 12 months and beyond
 to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operations and capital expenditures and such funding may not be available to us as a result of contracting capital and financial markets resulting from COVID-19
 it may have an adverse effect on our business.
""
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results will depend on future developments
 which are unpredictable and highly uncertain
 including the continued spread
 duration and severity of the outbreak
 the appearances of new variants of COVID-19
 the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19
 the availability and distribution of effective treatments and vaccines
 and public health measures and actions taken throughout the world to contain COVID-19. The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.
""
The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions
 product quality
 product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality (VR) experiences)
 energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life)
 reliability
 processor clock speed
 performance
 size (or form factor)
 selling price
 cost
 adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards)
 level of integration
 software and hardware compatibility
 ease of use and functionality of software design tools
 completeness of applicable software solutions
 security and stability
 brand recognition and availability.
""
We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes
 frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors
 especially during challenging economic times. In addition
 our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market
 leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies
 including interface
 processor and memory technical information. For instance
 with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics
 we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us
 demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition
 Intel is expanding its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments
 which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures and platforms like the ARM architecture. Increased adoption of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.
""
In addition
 we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore
 we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us.
""
We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts
 or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also
 the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers
 customers and partners in the industry.
""
Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
""
The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition
 our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example
 historically
 our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year
 although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.

If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad
 through patents
 copyrights
 trade secrets
 trademarks and other measures
 we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.
""
We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts
 including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements
 copyrights
 patents
 trademarks and common law rights
 such as trade secrets
 to protect our intellectual property. However
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged

Furthermore
 patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or
 if a patent is issued
 the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights
 others may independently develop similar products
 duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition
 it is difficult to monitor compliance with
 and enforce
 our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad
 our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised
 and our business would be materially adversely affected.
""
Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.
""
We have costs
 assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence
 movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue
 affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate
 we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flow. In addition
 the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.
""
Operational and Technology Risks
""
We rely on third parties to manufacture our products
 and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
""
We utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes
 and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also utilize TSMC
 United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co.
 Ltd. for our integrated circuits (IC) in the form of programmable logic devices. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble
 test
 mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package assembly partners are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.
""
We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers
 we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers
 which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition
 if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers
 it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example
 if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly
 we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs
 to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies
 including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers
 increase the prices that they charge us on short notice
 require onerous prepayments
 or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules
 yield
 cycle times
 quality assurance
 price increases
 lack of capacity in periods of excess demand
 misappropriation of our intellectual property
 dependence on several subcontractors
 and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover
 if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities
 lose benefits under material agreements
 experience power outages
 lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products
 encounter financial difficulties
 are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers
 suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency
 or experience uncertain social
 economic or political circumstances or conditions
 we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products
 our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.
""
If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers
 we may experience delayed product introductions
 lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer
 or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers
 we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
We are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021
 we entered into an amendment to the WSA
 and in December 2021
 we further amended these terms (the Amendment). Under the Amendment
 GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years
 we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025
 and AMD was obligated in 2022 and is obligated in 2023 to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target
 we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs
 both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations
 we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively
 the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co.
 Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs
 it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
If essential equipment
 materials
 substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products
 we could be materially adversely affected.
""
We may purchase equipment
 materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition
 as many of our products increase in technical complexity
 we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers
 or in some cases
 a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors
 including our APU products. Similarly
 certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory
 printed circuit boards (PCBs)
 interposers
 substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment
 materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements
 we could experience a shortage in equipment
 materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason
 it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely
 a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs
 particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers.

Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex
 it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another. From time to time
 suppliers may extend lead times
 limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also
 some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations
 or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products
 our business would be materially adversely affected.
""
Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.
""
Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design
 process technology and packaging technology
 which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer
 and low yields can result from design failures
 packaging technology failures
 process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions
 errors or difficulties during production
 we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop
 obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies
 products or processes earlier. Moreover
 during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies
 their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us
 particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example
 we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover
 we rely on TSMC
 UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products. Therefore
 the foundries
 particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC products
 must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes
 produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner.
""
Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs
 which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers
 which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.
""
The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.
""
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development
 qualification
 implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop
 qualify and distribute
 and have manufactured
 new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements
 at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis
 are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market
 PC sales could be negatively impacted
 which could adversely impact our business. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing
 qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly
 we may lose competitive positioning
 which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development
 we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop
 obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover
 our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue
 may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and
22

technologies will be successful
 will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation
 financial condition and operating results.
""
Delays in developing
 qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or
 in some cases
 breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products
 they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users
 which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products
 it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users
 which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition
 market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product
 the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
""
Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products.
""
The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result
 our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline
 our customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers’ products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover
 we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties
 and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently
 the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.
""
Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.
""
The products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in
 among other things
 the loss
 corruption
 theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance
 be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties
 such as customers and end users
 to deploy our mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations
 and they may delay
 decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products
 reduce or delay future purchases of our products
 or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity
 damage to our brand and reputation
 and could materially harm our business or financial results.

IT outages
 data loss
 data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information
 be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business
 reputation and operations.

In the ordinary course of our business
 we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets
 and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets
 including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The White House
 SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies’ cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. AMD and companies like AMD and our vendors and customers have been increasingly subject to cybersecurity attempts and threats. The increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements at AMD

and our providers has presented additional operational risks and cybersecurity attack vectors to our IT systems. These threats can come from a variety of sources
 all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic
 or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber threats have and may come into our network through malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software
 compromised commercial software or security vulnerabilities in our products or those of a third party that are being used by attackers prior to mitigations being put in place
 such as zero-day attacks. Cyber-attacks have and may come into our IT system through the compromise of our users’ access credentials. Users’ access credentials can be compromised by phishing
 vishing
 smishing
 multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing
 hacking

 defend against or prevent and have and may cause a disruption to our business. Our network and storage applications
 as well as those of our customers
 business partners

 may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error
 malfeasance or other system disruptions.
""
It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incidents or mitigate quickly enough to stop an attack. These data breaches and any unauthorized access
 misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information or personally identifiable information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers
 business partners or third-party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs
 result in product development delays
 disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability
 expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.
""
We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. In addition
 many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information
 such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act
 and failure to comply or a breach of personally identifiable information could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments or litigation by other entities.
""
""
We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls
 including costs related to upgrading application
 computer
 and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating
 responding to and remediating any data security breach
 and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.
""
We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. We also provide sensitive information to vendors
 customers and contractors. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices
 or in the event of a breach of their networks
 our workers’ data and sensitive information may be improperly accessed
 used or disclosed.

A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information
 IT outages

We may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning system
 which could materially adversely affect us.
""
We are currently upgrading our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. The adoption of a new ERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges
 both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Costs and risks inherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruption
s to
business continuity
 difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls
 administrative and technical problems
 interruptions or delays in sales processes
 expenditure overruns
 and data migration issues. If we do not properly address or mitigate these issues it could result in increased costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources
 negatively impacting our operating results and ability to effectively manage our business. Moreover
 once our ERP system is upgraded
 it may not operate as we expect it to

and cause disruption to our operations. There are no assurances that our new ERP system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.
""
We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally
 our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products
 which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers
 as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. For instance
 we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products
 it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles
 which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition
 our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example
 in the second half of 2022
 we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth
 and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory
 which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of
 or delay in receiving certain components to build their products
 which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance
 OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.
""
Excess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example
 in the third quarter of 2022
 we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory
 pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Other factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include
 a reduction in the average selling price
 or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products
 including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.
""
Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes use of third-party intellectual property.
""
In the design and development of new and enhanced products
 we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore
 certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable
 is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame
 manufacturing technology
 or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands

Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products
 we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly
 the success of our products in the market

 or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors
 our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.
""
Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.
""
We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us
 decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all
 our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition
 if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
""
Additionally
 distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances
 our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions
 as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products
 the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.
""
Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business
 processes and internal controls.
""
We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions
 and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such
 our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.
""
These changes may also require changes in our information systems
 modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems
 and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners
 may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events

In addition
 as our IT environment continues to evolve
 we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However
 these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment
 making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users
 and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes
 or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements
 our business would be materially adversely affected.

If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware
 we could be materially adversely affected.
""
Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further
 we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware
 we could be materially adversely affected. In addition
 the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.
""
Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that
 despite our testing procedures
 errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future
 which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products
 material recall and replacement costs
 loss of revenue
 writing down the inventory of defective products
 the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts
 defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities
 including property damage
 personal injury
 damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property
 and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition
 we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result
 we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.
""
We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes
 or merely appears to have caused
 an injury
 whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products
 and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim
 recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products
 our business could be materially adversely affected.
""
Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends
 in part
 on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly
 we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing
 distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business
 expand to high-growth adjacent markets
 acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers
 the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products
 geographic requirements
 and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations
 our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us

Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.
""
We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time
 our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us
 thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also
 when gray market products enter the market
 we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products
 which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition
 our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products
 including products that may have been altered
 mishandled or damaged
 or are used products represented as new.
""
Legal and Regulatory Risks
""
Government actions and regulations such as export regulations
 tariffs
 and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.
""
We have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively
 the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co.
 Ltd. (THATIC)
 a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019
 the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List
 including THATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time
 the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy
 including policies with respect to China and Russia. Specifically
 United States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues to add more Chinese companies to the Entity List and more regulations targeted to advanced computing
 semiconductor manufacturing
 and AI. Further
 the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia
 Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine
 due to the conflict in Ukraine. BIS has issued new requirements that prevent us from shipping MI250 and MI250X integrated circuits to China and Russia without a license. BIS may possibly issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in the future. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs
 trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. There is also a possibility of future tariffs
 trade protection measures
 import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States
 China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Export control restrictions may adversely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all.
""
We may
 from time to time
 receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR)
 which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR and ITAR govern the export and re-export of certain AMD products
 including FPGAs
 and the transfer of related technologies
 whether in the U.S. or abroad
 and the provision of services. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses
 or to predict when they will be granted
 increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition
 security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges
 as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers

If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets
 our results of operations could be adversely affected.
""
Our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter
 we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable
 it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
""
In addition
 a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383
 separate return loss year rules
 or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.
""
Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities
 and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations
 changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations
 or unfavorable assessments from tax audits
 any of which could affect our effective tax rates
 financial condition
 and results of operations.
""
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax
 indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors
 including
 but not limited to
 changes to our corporate operating structure
 intercompany arrangements
 and tax planning strategies.
""
Our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates
 financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned
 by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets.
""
In addition
 we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates
 financial condition
 and results of operations.
""
In the ordinary course of our business
 there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax
 indirect tax
 or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable
 we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit
 assessment or litigation
 there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
""
We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.
""
From time to time
 we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions
 as described in Note 17 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example
 we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers
 which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion
 we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions
 and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us
 it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.

 actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others
 contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others
 improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted
 we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms
 if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted
 which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages
 including material royalty payments
 or other types of damages
 or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide
 in the alternative
 to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit
 could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.
""
Even if we were to prevail
 any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.

We are subject to environmental laws
 conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.

Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations
 including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes
 discharge of pollutants into the environment
 the treatment
 transport
 storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. For the manufacturing of our products
 these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations
 including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance
 we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws
 regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them
 a range of consequences could result
 including fines
 suspension of production
 alteration of manufacturing processes
 import/export restrictions
 sales limitations
 criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply
 higher sourcing costs
 and/or reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used
 stored
 released
 disposed of by us or located at
 under or emanating from our current or former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures
 we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore
 we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws
 and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of
 or exposure to
 hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.
""
Environmental laws are complex
 change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example
 the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world
 there is a risk that the cost
 quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions
 or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps
 or produce sudden changes in demand
 which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU
 Australia
 California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.

Certain environmental laws
 including the United States Comprehensive
 Environmental Response
 Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
 or the Superfund Act
 impose strict or
 under certain circumstances
 joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of
 or was not responsible for
 the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale
 California. Although we have not been

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements
 such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process
 determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products
 auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation
 the European Union
 China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains
 we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover
 we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers
 they may choose a competitor’s products.
""
In addition to our company
 customers
 governments and authorities continue to be focused on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. For example
 the United States Uyghur Forced Labor Prevent Act prohibits goods mined
 produced or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China
 or by certain entities
 from entering the United States under the presumption of being made with forced labor. Germany’s federal procurement office
 in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association
 has issued supply chain labor requirements. In addition
 the United Kingdom
 Australia and the State of California have enacted laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences
 if any
 that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain
 we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover
 we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product.

Merger
 Acquisition and Integration Risks
""
Acquisitions
 joint ventures and/or investments and the failure to integrate acquired businesses
 could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock.
""
Our success will depend
 in part
 on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies
 customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances
 we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses
 solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult
 time-consuming and costly
 and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures.

For example
 on February 14
 2022
 we completed our acquisition of Xilinx and on May 26
 2022
 we completed our acquisition of Pensando. While we believe these acquisitions will result in certain benefits
 including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies
 and drive product innovations
 achieving these anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and the acquired companies’ businesses together. It is not certain that the acquired companies can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all
 or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons
 including
 but not limited to: our inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other resources
 including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the integration; failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees
 vendors
 suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with
 or the loss of
 the acquired companies’ employees
 vendors
 suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired companies’ financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs
 decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention
 which could materially impact the combined company. In addition
 even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully
 the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the combined company. If we cannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies’ businesses and operations
 or if there are delays in combining the businesses
 it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business
 which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
""
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently
 we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures
 which could harm our operating results. In addition
 to complete an acquisition
 we may issue equity securities
 which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock
 and/or incur debt
 assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets
 which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover
 if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing
 we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture
 we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business
 technologies
 solutions
 assets
 personnel or operations
 particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us.
""
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses
 which could harm our business. Also
 any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore
 we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations
 products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs
 and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs
 it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
In addition
 we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives. For example
 we may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance
 including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019
 the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List
 including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation.

We account for certain acquisitions
 including the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions
 using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805
 Business Combinations
 with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired
 including identifiable intangible assets
 and liabilities assumed
 at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions
 we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
""
Indefinite-lived intangible assets
 including goodwill
 are tested for impairment at least annually
 and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If
 in the future
 we determine that tangible or intangible assets
 including goodwill
 are impaired
 we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions
 particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis
 we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances
 such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results
 changes in management’s business strategy
 an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace
 an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price
 which may represent an indicator of impairment. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges
 which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.

""
The agreements governing our notes
 our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes
 and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
""
The indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to
 among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt
 enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with
 merge into or sell
 convey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person.
""
Additionally
 in connection with the acquisition of Xilinx
 we entered into supplemental indentures for the Assumed Xilinx Notes pursuant to which all obligations of Xilinx under the Assumed Xilinx Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us. The indentures governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to
 among other things
 create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries
 enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property
 and consolidate or merge with
 or convey
 transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets
 taken as a whole
 to another person.
""
We also have a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to
 among other things
 incur liens and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case
 except for certain customary exceptions). In addition
 our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Agreement contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in cross defaults under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement. For example
 the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes)
 and (ii) $500 million would cause a cross default under the Revolving Credit Agreement (to the extent such default (other than the failure to repay indebtedness) would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness). The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 2.125% Notes or

Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations
 including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital
 capital expenditures
 acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital
 capital expenditures
 acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.

We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables
 which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons
 and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances
 such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.
""
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. Also
 if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow
 we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
""
Our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance
 which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter
 and is subject to prevailing economic
 financial and business conditions along with other factors
 many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
 we may be required to sell assets or equity
 reduce expenditures
 refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing.
""
In addition
 our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing
 if necessary. Our research and development expenditures
 together with ongoing operating expenses
 will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors
 technological advances by existing competitors
 or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts
 our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue
 our operating results could decline.
""
Our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects
 our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
""
General Risks
""
Our worldwide operations are subject to political
 legal and economic risks and natural disasters
 which could have a material adverse effect on us.
""
We maintain operations around the world
 including in the United States
 Canada
 Europe
 Australia
 Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States
 Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities
 operated by third-party manufacturing facilities
 in China
 Malaysia and Taiwan. We also depend on third-party subcontractors to provide shipment services. We also have international sales operations. International sales
 as a percent of net revenue
 were 66% for the year ended December 31
 2022. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.

The political
 legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include
 without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws
 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions
 including interest rates
 inflation and recession; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international operations
 including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently
 the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia
 Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine
 due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also
 geopolitical changes between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan based third-party wafer foundries
 manufacturing facilities and subcontractors
 and materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and/or operating results
.
""
In addition
 our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes
 tsunamis
 flooding
 typhoons
 droughts
 fires
 extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations
 or those of our manufacturers
 vendors or customers. For example
 our Santa Clara and San Jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also
 we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves
 wildfires and freezing. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate
 including public health issues (for example
 an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19
 avian influenza
 measles or Ebola)
 safety issues
 natural disasters
 fire
 disruptions of service from utilities
 nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example
 governments worldwide have implemented
 and continue to implement
 measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced
 and will continue to experience
 disruptions to our business as these measures have
 and will continue to have
 an effect on our business operations and practices.
""
In addition
 many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information
 such as the European Union’s general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act
 and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant requirements on how we collect
 process and transfer personal data
 as well as significant fines for non-compliance.
""
Any of the above risks
 should they occur
 could result in an increase in the cost of components
 production and shipment delays
 general business interruptions
 the inability to obtain
 or delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology
 penalties or a loss of export privileges
 as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to international customers
 tariffs and other barriers and restrictions
 longer payment cycles
 increased taxes
 restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws
 any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
""
We may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.
""
We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets
 changes in competing technologies
 and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.

Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.
""
Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering
 marketing
 sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract
 train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business
 the progress of our product development programs could be hindered
 and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract
 retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees
 we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock
 or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit
 our ability to attract
 retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened
 which could harm our results of operations. Also
 if the value of our stock awards increases substantially
 this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition
 any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.
""
Our stock price is subject to volatility.
""
Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results
 changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts
 changes in our capital structure
 including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public
 interest rate changes
 inflation
 news regarding our products or products of our competitors
 and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation
 which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition
 volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.
""
In May 2021
 our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our common stock (Existing Repurchase Program). In February 2022
 our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program in addition to our Existing Repurchase Program to purchase up to $8 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market (collectively referred to as the Repurchase Program). The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock
 has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock
 the volatility of our stock price
 reduce our cash reserves
 and may be suspended or discontinued at any time
 which may result in a decrease in our stock price.
""
Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.
""
Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict
 political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable
 and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations
 or adversely affect demand for our products
 and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore
 these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive
 which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In May 2021
 our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our common stock (Existing Repurchase Program). In February 2022
 our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program in addition to the Existing Repurchase Program to purchase up to additional $8 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market (collectively referred to as the “Repurchase Program”). We expect to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by our strong operational results. Our Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock
 has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The following table provides information relating to our repurchase of common stock for the year ended December 31

Introduction
In this section
 we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices
 Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively
 “us
” “our” or “AMD”)
 including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021
 an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II
 Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25
 2021.
Overview
2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022
 we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx
 Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
 Adaptive SoCs
 and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx
 we have access to a new set of markets and customers
 further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022
 we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems
 Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions
 we are well positioned to provide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance
 security
 flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.
""
Our 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion
 an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors
 a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales
 and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin
 as a percentage of net revenue for 2022
 was 45%
 compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.
Cash
 cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31
 2022 were $5.9 billion
 compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31
 2022 was $2.5 billion
 compared to $313 million as of December 25
 2021.
We took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022
 we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes
 consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1
 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum
 and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1
 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations.

We also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31
 2022. In November 2022
 we established a new commercial paper program
 under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or
 alternatively
 will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31
 2022
 we had no commercial paper outstanding.
During the twelve months ended December 31
 2022
 we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31
 2022
 $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock
 has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices
 we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements
 the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period
 the primary factors that resulted in those changes
 and how certain accounting principles
 policies and estimates affect our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis
 including those related to our revenue
 inventories
 business combination
 goodwill
 long-lived and intangible assets
 and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations
 the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult
 subjective and complex judgments.
Revenue Allowances.
Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return
 rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.
We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience
 including actual historical returns
 rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted
 as applicable
 to include adjustments
 if any
 for known events or current economic conditions
 or both.
Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.
Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize
 in addition to known pricing agreements
 actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.
We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated
 we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise
 we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities
 such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.
We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments
 although
 from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns
 including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers
 we utilize relevant
 trended actual historical product return rate information gathered
 adjusted for actual known information or events
 as applicable.
Overall
 our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers
 based on our assumptions and include adjustments
 if any
 for known events
 have been materially consistent with actual results; however
 these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions
 resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.

 adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products
 we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions
 other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products
 and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves
 we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices
 as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates
 additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales
 resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period
 related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall
 our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.
Business Combinations.
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired
 liabilities assumed
 and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions
 especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing developed technology
 in-process research and development
 customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include
 but are not limited to
 expected future revenue growth rates and margins
 future changes in technology
 time to recreate customer relationships
 useful lives
 and discount rates.
Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable
 but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and
 as a result
 actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense
 as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life
 whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets
 including goodwill
 are not amortized. During the measurement period
 which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date
 we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period
 any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
""
Goodwill.
Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center
 Gaming and Embedded.
""
We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and
 if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred
 on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment
 which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach
 which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit
 and the market approach
 which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions
 growth rates of our reporting units in the near- and long-term
 expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections
 and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit
 the determination of an appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit
 and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.

The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates (including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates
 the competitive environment and inflation. As a result
 long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive environment. Discount rates
 which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant
 are based upon industry required rates of return
 including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment
 prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures
 volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors that otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing
 the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets.
""
Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use
 we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets
 the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale
 we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.
Income Taxes
. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes
 we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.
We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%)
 we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence
 if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets
 we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance
 which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.
In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance
 we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
Through the end of 2022
 we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal
 state
 and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations
 under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383
 separate return loss year rules
 or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
In addition
 the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex
 multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.

Results of Operations
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022
 we changed our reporting segments to align our financial reporting with how we manage our business in strategic end markets. This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result
 we report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center
 Client
 Gaming
 and Embedded.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4
–
Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II
 Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically
 our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year
 although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.
The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021:

Data Center
Data Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%
 compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors.
Data Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022
 compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue
 partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
Client
Client net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%
 compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021
 primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit shipment
 partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.
Client operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022
 compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.

Gaming
Gaming net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022 increased by 21%
 compared to net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2021. The increase in net revenue was driven by higher semi-custom product sales due to higher demand for gaming console SoCs
 partially offset by lower gaming graphics sales due to a decrease in unit shipments driven by soft consumer demand given weakened macroeconomic conditions experienced in the second half of 2022.
Gaming operating income was $953 million in 2022
 compared to operating income of $934 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue
 partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
Embedded
Embedded net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022 increased significantly
 compared to net revenue of $246 million in 2021. The significant increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue as a result of the acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022.
Embedded operating income was $2.3 billion in 2022
 compared to operating income of $44 million in 2021. The significant increase in operating income was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue.
All Other
All Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles
 $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense
 and $452 million of acquisition-related costs
 which primarily include transaction costs
 amortization of Xilinx inventory fair value step-up adjustment
 and depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment
 certain compensation charges related to the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando
 and licensing gain. All Other operating loss of $409 million in 2021 primarily consisted of $379 million of stock-based compensation expense and $42 million of acquisition-related costs.

Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses of $5.0 billion in 2022 increased by $2.2 billion
 or 76%
 compared to $2.8 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments across all of our segments
 including an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth.
Marketing
 General and Administrative Expenses
Marketing
 general and administrative expenses of $2.3 billion in 2022 increased by $888 million
 or 61%
 compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth
 go-to-market activities
 and acquisition-related costs.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles
In 2022
 cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion
 respectively
 of amortization expense from intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.
Licensing Gain
During 2022
 we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV
 our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co.
 Ltd.
 a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized a licensing gain from royalty income of $12 million for the year ended December 25
 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $88 million in 2022 increased by $54 million compared to $34 million in 2021
 primarily due to interest expense from the 2.95% Senior Notes due 2024 and the 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 (together
 the Assumed Xilinx Notes) and the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued in 2022.
Other Income (Expense)
 net
Other income (expense)
 net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments
 changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Other income
 net was $8 million in 2022 compared to $55 million of Other income
 net in 2021. The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the fair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021
 partially offset by $65 million of interest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
""
We recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021
 representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%
 respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.
Through the end of fiscal year 2022
 we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal
 state
 and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383
 separate return loss year rules
 or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
International Sales
International sales as a percentage of net revenue were

in 2022 and 72% in 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31
 2022
 our cash
 cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of December 25
 2021. The increase in cash
 cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by the $2.4 billion of cash and $1.6 billion of short-term investments acquired from the Xilinx acquisition
 $1.0 billion from the debt issuance of our 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes
 and cash flows from operations
 partially offset by stock repurchases and cash paid for the acquisition of Pensando. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 73% as of December 31
 2022
 and 91% as of December 25
 2021.

Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 31
 2022
 which consisted primarily of $1.5 billion of the Xilinx Notes assumed as part of the Xilinx acquisition and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued during the year
 compared to $313 million as of December 25
 2021
 respectively. We repaid $312 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes that matured in August 2022.
On April 29
 2022
 we entered into a revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank
 N.A. as administrative agent and other banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31
 2022.
On November 3
 2022
 we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or
 alternatively
 will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31
 2022
 we had no commercial paper outstanding.
As of December 31
 2022
 we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $8.6 billion
 of which $6.5 billion are in fiscal year 2023. On an ongoing basis
 we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments
 taking into account business conditions.
We believe our cash
 cash equivalents
 short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations
 including capital expenditures and purchase commitments
 over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However
 we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms
 or at all.
Operating Activities
Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers
 payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022
 primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion in 2022
 adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products
 a $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021
 and a $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022
 offset by an $931 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers
 and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher customer-related accruals.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021
 primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021
 adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020
 a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand
 and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021
 offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers
 and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other
 both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals
 and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $2 billion in 2022
 which primarily consisted of higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $4.3 billion and cash acquired as part of the acquisition of Xilinx of $2.4 billion
 partially offset by higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.7 billion
 cash used in the acquisition of Pensando of $1.5 billion and $450 million for purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021
 which primarily consisted of higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment
 partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $1.7 billion.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2022
 which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $3.7 billion under the Repurchase Program
 higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $406 million and repayment of debt of $312 million
 partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $991 million and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $167 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021
 which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.8 billion under the Repurchase Program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $237 million
 partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $104 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31
 2022
 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 7A.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly
 our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31
 2022
 our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments
 time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy
 we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 31
 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by approximately $2.9 million.
As of December 31
 2022
 all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently
 our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.
We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.
Default Risk.
We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.
We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31
 2022
 substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks
 such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.
Foreign Exchange Risk.
As a result of our foreign operations
 we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
 while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31
 2022 and December 25
 2021. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months.
