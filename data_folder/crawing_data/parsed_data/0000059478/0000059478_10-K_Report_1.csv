Marketing and Distribution
We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations.
U.S.
We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways
 including promoting in online channels
 distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians
 and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition
 we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S.
 and we maintain websites and other media channels (e.g.
 social media) with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need.
Our account managers service wholesalers
 pharmacy benefit managers
 managed care organizations
 group purchasing organizations
 government and long-term care institutions
 hospitals
 and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations to provide discounts or rebates on our products.
In the U.S.
 most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies
 physicians and other healthcare professionals
 and hospitals. In 2023
 2022
 and 2021
 three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation
 Cencora
 Inc. (formerly AmerisourceBergen Corporation)
 and Cardinal Health
 Inc.—each accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years. For additional information

Outside the U.S.
The products we market and their distribution vary from country to country. Outside the U.S.
 we promote our products to healthcare providers through sales representatives and other channels. In most countries in which we operate
 we maintain our own sales organizations
 but in some countries we market our products through third parties
 some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.
Marketing Collaborations
Certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example
 we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products
 including Trajenta

Competition
Our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.
Important competitive factors include effectiveness
 safety
 and ease of use; formulary placement
 price
 payer coverage and reimbursement rates
 and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products
 processes
 modalities
 and uses. Early market entry and rapid patient access can also be important to achieve product acceptance and success.
Most new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded
 biosimilar
 or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products
 uses
 or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages
 including by developing new modalities
 our products become subject to decreased sales volumes
 progressive price reductions
 or both.
We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative
 cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers
 and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products
 and it is possible that our products will be
 or will become
 uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or uses developed by our competitors.
Generic Pharmaceuticals and Biosimilars
Generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars can pose major competitive challenges to our business. In most major jurisdictions
 the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy
 allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result
 generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly
 when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity
 it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product
 which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the branded product's revenue in a very short period of time. Moreover
 governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume-based procurement bidding and other measures.
Further
 public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to branded products. Laws in the U.S. generally allow
 and in many cases require
 pharmacists to substitute generics that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a branded product. Where substitution is mandatory
 it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries
 intellectual property protection is weak
 and we must compete with generic versions of our products at or relatively shortly after launch.
In addition
 competition for our biologics
 which constitute a substantial portion of our products and pipeline
 may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics
 also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that
 due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic
 may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic.
Globally
 most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator biologics
 including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in
8

""
""
the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA
 as well as in Europe and Japan. Regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve
 and therefore the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty. For example
 the extent to which a biosimilar
 once approved
 will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing.
Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have developed biosimilars that compete with our products
 we have developed our own biosimilar and may develop others in the future.

 consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans
 managed care organizations
 pharmacy benefit managers
 wholesalers
 pharmacies
 and other supply chain entities have been consolidating into fewer
 larger entities
 thus enhancing their market power and importance. Private third-party insurers
 as well as governments
 typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement.
Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a product for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions
 such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions
 or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost
 such as non-preferred co-pay tiers
 increased co-insurance levels
 and higher deductibles. Consequently
 pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations
 and compete fiercely for formulary placement
 not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy
 safety profile
 or patient ease of use
 but also by providing rebates or other concessions. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates
 value-based agreements
 where rebates may be based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes
 are another increasingly prevalent tool. Rebates and net cost are increasingly important factors in formulary decisions
 particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These pressures have negatively affected
 and could continue to negatively affect
 our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement
 changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans
 higher co-insurance
 or co-pays
 including increased utilization of co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs. Supply chain entities have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products.

Patents
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Overview
Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines and uses. Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals
 especially for non-biologic products
 typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product
 often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. We own
 have applied for
 or are licensed under
 a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products
 product uses
 formulations
 and manufacturing processes. In addition
 for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.
The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent) for our products
 particularly those in major markets such as the U.S.
 major European countries
 and Japan. In general
 patents in each relevant country last for a period of 20 years from their filing date
 which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:
•
Patent term adjustment is available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
•
Patent term restoration for a single patent for a pharmaceutical product is provided to U.S. patent holders to compensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review process. There is a five-year cap on any restoration
 and no patent's

""
""
expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example
 Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five years.
In some cases
 the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic
 biosimilar
 or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics and challenges
 later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes
 methods of use or formulations
 or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:
•
Data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA
 subject to certain conditions)
 effectively 10 years in Europe
 and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents.
•
In the U.S.
 the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted
" this ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity"
 which is added to the term of data protection
 orphan drug exclusivity and
 for products other than biologics
 to the term of any relevant and non-expired patents.
•
"A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200"
000 people in the U.S.
 or where it is not reasonably expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Orphan designation entitles a particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity
 which runs in parallel with any applicable patents.
Outside the major markets
 the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals vary widely. International and U.S. free trade agreements like the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) administered by the World Trade Organization provide global protection of certain intellectual property rights. But in a number of markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Further
 many developing countries
 and some developed countries
 do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement.
Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
We consider intellectual property protection for certain products
 processes
 uses
 and formulations to be important to our business. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below
 we may hold patents on manufacturing processes
 formulations
 devices
 or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved products
 dates include
 where applicable
 pending or granted patent term extensions.

Patent Challenges
In the U.S.
 the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984
 commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act
 authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics) when the generic manufacturer files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).
Absent a patent challenge
 the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However
 after the innovator has marketed its product for four years
 a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that the patent(s) listed in the innovator's New Drug Application (NDA) are invalid
 unenforceable or not infringed.
Generic manufacturers use this process extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition
" generic companies have shown willingness to launch ""at risk"
""" i.e."
 after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.
Under the BPCIA
 the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires
 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic
 and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However
 the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.
The patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA
 and the BPCIA itself
 is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA
 as well as by courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. In addition
 there is a procedure in U.S. patent law
 known as inter partes review (IPR)
 which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court and challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. In addition
 in December 2023
" the U.S. presidential administration released a proposed framework that would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a factor in determining whether it may exercise ""march-in rights"" and license it to a third party to manufacture. A comment period on the proposal runs through February 6"
 2024
 and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be adopted in accordance with the proposed framework.
Outside the U.S.
 the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In recent years
 we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the U.S.

Government Regulation of Our Operations
Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous government agencies.
Regulation of Products
The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing
 data analysis
 manufacturing development
 and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation. In addition
 our operations are subject to complex federal
 state
 local
 and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers
 pricing and reimbursement for our products
 the environment
 occupational health and safety
 data privacy and security
 and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and those of other healthcare intermediaries
 including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations. Regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment and interpretation
 which can result in inconsistent administration of laws and regulations by health authorities. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery
 development
 and introduction of new products and uses has and will continue to require substantial effort
 expense
 and capital investment.
Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)
 the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing
 safety
 effectiveness
 manufacturing
 quality control
 distribution
 labeling
 marketing
 promotion
 advertising
 dissemination of information
 and post-marketing surveillance of those products and devices. The FDA holds broad discretion under the FDCA and other statutes to interpret the conditions and evidence necessary for timely approval of our drugs and devices.
Following approval
 our products remain subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies in connection with labeling
 import
 export
 sale
 storage
 recordkeeping
 advertising
 promotion
 and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell and comply with notification requirements related to safety and efficacy
 product supply
 and other aspects of our products and operations. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market
 including as may be identified through market surveillance or third-party studies involving our products. The FDA may also mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product's life cycle based on new safety information or as part of a labeling change to a particular class of products. In addition
 the FDA strictly regulates marketing
 labeling
 advertising
 and promotion of products to prescribers and patients. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
Outside the U.S.
 our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements
 notably by the EMA in Europe
 the Ministry of Health
 Labor and Welfare in Japan
 and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Regulatory and compliance requirements
 as well as approval processes outside the U.S.
 may differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks.
The FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under their cGMP regulations. Regulators assess compliance with these regulations by inspecting the equipment
 facilities
 laboratories
 and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our products prior to marketing approval with periodic reinspection thereafter; this may include inspection of our third-party business partners. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive
 company-wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing
 product development
 and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Nonetheless
 manufacturing quality and other aspects of pharmaceutical regulatory compliance is heavily scrutinized and results in government investigations
 regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of any issues
 any of which have and could adversely affect our business and reputation. Certain of our products
 devices and components are manufactured by third parties
 and their failure to comply with these regulations has and could in the future adversely affect us
 including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products or indications. For example
 in 2023 we received complete response letters based on FDA observations made during inspections of manufacturing facilities rather than any issues related to efficacy or safety. These resulted in certain delays in the approval of new products.

Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and reputation. For more information on product regulation challenges
 see Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business."""
Emergency Use Authorizations
The Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to authorize unapproved medical products
 or unapproved uses of approved medical products
 to be manufactured
 marketed
 and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. For example
 certain of our products were previously made available for the treatment of COVID-19 under respective EUAs. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates
 and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances
 the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict.
Outside the U.S.
 the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that vary and differ from those in the U.S.
Other Laws and Regulations
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws
 as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations
 including the federal anti-kickback statute
 the False Claims Act
 antitrust laws
 and state laws governing kickbacks
 false claims
 unfair trade practices
 and consumer protection. These laws are administered by
 among others
 the Department of Justice
 the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
 the Federal Trade Commission
 the Office of Personnel Management
 and state attorneys general. State
 federal
 and foreign governments
 agencies
 and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight
 enforcement activities
 and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies
 which has resulted in intensified scrutiny
 litigation costs
 corporate criminal sanctions
 and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities
 including U.S. publicly traded companies
 from promising
 offering
 or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above
 our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with officials outside the U.S. Additionally
 in many countries outside the U.S.
 healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore
 our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.
In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA
 the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years
 several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area
 increased their enforcement activities
 and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.
We are
 and could in the future become
 subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions
 which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages)
 criminal sanctions
 and administrative remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations
 liquidity
 and financial position in any given period.
We are also subject to a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign environmental
 health and safety
 and other laws and regulations that may affect our research
 development
 or production efforts.

Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
U.S.
There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition
 U.S. government actions to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs
 including Medicare and Medicaid
 may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products.
In August 2022
 the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures
 the IRA requires HHS to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally
 these government prices apply nine years (for medicines approved under an NDA) or thirteen years (for medicines approved under a Biologics License Application (BLA)) following initial FDA approval and will be set at a price that is likely to represent a significant discount from existing average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a ceiling price
 it does not set a minimum or floor price. In August 2023
 HHS selected Jardiance
 which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim
 as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. Given our product portfolio
 we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years
 which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.
Other IRA provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also
 the Part D benefit redesign will replace the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program (CGDP) with a new manufacturer discount program. Beginning in January 2025
 the 70 percent CGDP discount will be replaced by a 10 percent manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2
000 threshold and a 20 percent discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2
000 threshold under the Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties
 including civil monetary penalties
 which could be significant.
The IRA has and will meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular
 the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under an NDA reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The IRA can cause changes to development approach
 and timing and investments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry
 including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting
 remains uncertain.
Heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products and the practices of pharmacy benefit managers and other supply chain entities has also resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to
 among other things
 bring more transparency to product pricing
 review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs
 require advance notice of list price increases
 establish upper payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards
 allow the importation of drugs from other countries
 address pharmacy benefit manager practices
 and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 courts
 or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results. Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress
 the U.S. executive branch and regulatory authorities worldwide
 could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.
In the U.S.
 we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs
 including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (a minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B covered entities). Additionally
 an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs.
Changes to the 340B program or the Medicaid programs could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example
 continued expansion of the 340B program and growth of entities claiming entitlement to 340B pricing
 including in ways that may be inconsistent with the statutory scheme
 impacts our revenue on an increasing percentage of sales. Changes to the calculation of rebates under the Medicaid program could also increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices charged to 340B covered entities.
16

16
""
""
We have implemented a Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System applicable to sales through the 340B program
 which generally limits distribution of 340B-priced product to: (i) covered entities and their child sites; (ii) contract pharmacies wholly owned by the covered entity; or (iii) if a covered entity lacks an in-house outpatient pharmacy
 a single contract pharmacy designated by a covered entity to establish a 340B bill to/ship to arrangement. Our Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System contains certain exceptions that permit broader contract pharmacy usage
" including for ""penny priced"" insulin products"
 provided that the covered entity passes through all discounts to eligible patients at the point of sale and meets other conditions. We believe our Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System complies with the 340B statute
 but it remains subject to ongoing inquiries and litigation that could have a material impact on our business
 as discussed in Item 8
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies."" Other aspects of the 340B program"
" including the proper definitions of ""patient"" and ""child site"" under the 340B statute"
 are also subject to ongoing litigation by other parties
 the resolution of which could impact the growth and scope of the 340B program.
Rebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the anti-kickback statute's discount safe harbor
 which have been stayed until at least January 1
 2032.
For a discussion of risks related to how we price our products
 see Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face litigation and investigations related to our products"
 how we price or commercialize our products
 and other aspects of our business
 which could adversely affect our business
" and we are self-insured for such matters."""
Outside the U.S.
Globally
 public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value
 including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition
 third-party organizations
 including professional associations
 academic institutions
 and non-profit entities associated with payers
 conduct and publish comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines
 the impact of which can influence pharmaceutical access and pricing.
In most international markets
 we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs
 which may include price controls
 international reference pricing (to other countries' prices)
 discounts and rebates
 therapeutic reference pricing (to other
 often generic
 pharmaceutical choices)
 regulatory hurdles
 restrictions on physician prescription levels
 and mandatory generic substitution. In these markets
 healthcare services and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products are impacted by government control at the point of care or as the primary payer.
The European Commission published its draft General Pharmaceutical Legislation in April 2023. While certain elements in the European Commission draft could expedite regulatory timelines
 we anticipate that the overall market and patient impact would be negative if the legislation is approved as drafted. Implementation timing is unknown at this time. Health care cost containment remains a focus in the EU
 among other jurisdictions. Most countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in some form of reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined internal or external markets for published prices of a product or national class of drugs. Member states also have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and may condition access on agreement of a reimbursement price or completion of cost-effectiveness or other gating studies.
In Japan
 our products generally are subject to government-mandated annual price reductions. The government may also order re-pricings for specific products or classes of products if certain criteria are met
 including exceeding product use thresholds.
China has introduced and implemented reforms to accelerate access to innovative products and reduce costs. To drive patient access
 we seek inclusion of many of our branded products on China's National Reimbursement Drug List
 a list of drugs fully or partially reimbursed by China’s national basic health insurance. In exchange for broad access
 these products are generally subject to negotiation of significant price concessions. China also utilizes a value-based procurement program process for products that have generic substitutes. Products that we choose to tender through this process are similarly subject to price reductions. Our performance in China may be significantly impacted by the country's evolving pharmaceutical regulatory environment
 including access
 intellectual property protection
 regulatory enforcement and compliance
 and trade policies.

""
""
Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on limiting health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property. Reforms in our product markets
 including those that may stem from periods of uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty
 or as a result of high inflation
 emergence
 or escalation of
 and responses to
 international tension and conflicts
 or government budgeting priorities
 may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by current or potential future legislative
 regulatory
 or payer developments. However
 in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing
 resulting in additional state
 federal
 and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products as well as overall operations.

 and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.
Research and Development
Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2023
 we employed approximately 10
000 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities
 including a substantial number of physicians
 scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees
 and highly skilled technical personnel.
Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of metabolism (including diabetes
 obesity and cardiovascular)
 immunology
 neuroscience
 and oncology. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines
 we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses
 formulations
 and therapeutic approaches
 including complementary delivery devices or diagnostic tools
 that can provide additional value to patients.
To supplement our internal efforts
 we collaborate with others
 including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians
 hospitals
 medical schools
 and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including
 among others
 licensing arrangements
 co-development agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 joint ventures
 acquisitions
 and equity investments.
Pharmaceutical development is time-consuming
 expensive
 and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process
 and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. In addition
 novel modalities can present more challenging or lengthy development timelines. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:
Phases of New Drug Development
•
Discovery Phase
In the discovery phase
 scientists identify
 design
 and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development
 which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.
18
18
18
""
""
•
Early Development Phase
Early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals
 as necessary. In general
 the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently
 larger populations of patients are studied (Phase II) to identify signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel
 scientists work to identify safe
 effective
 and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase
 approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete.
•
Late Development Phase
Late phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result
 these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies
 placebo
 or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally
 are costly
 and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take years.
•
Submission Phase
Once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies
 the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years
 depending on the disease state
 the strength and complexity of available data
 the degree of unmet need
 and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission
 which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval
 or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline"
""" for more information on our late-stage product candidates."
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However
 certain raw or intermediate materials are procured from a single source. We seek to maintain sufficient inventory to provide reliability of production and manage unforeseen supply variability. However
 various developments have led
 and may in the future lead
 to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources
 implement alternative processes
 bring new manufacturing facilities online
 or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S.
 including Puerto Rico
 and Ireland. Finishing operations
 including formulation
 filling
 assembling
 delivery device manufacturing
 and packaging
 take place at a number of sites throughout the world. To support anticipated demand for our current and prospective products
 we have undertaken significant manufacturing expansion initiatives. During 2023
 commercial production commenced at our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in Durham
 North Carolina. Further investments to increase our manufacturing capacity include planned sites in Concord
 North Carolina
 Limerick
 Ireland
 Alzey
 Rhineland-Palatinate
 Germany
 and two in Lebanon
 Indiana. We also utilize and are expanding arrangements with third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing
 filling
 finishing operations
 and for device or component production and assembly.
We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities
 contracted arrangements
 and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products
 we use a variety of techniques
 including comprehensive quality systems
 inventory management
 and back-up sites.

However
 pharmaceutical production processes are complex
 highly regulated
 and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity is a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures
 process modifications
 and regulatory approvals. Accordingly
 developments such as unanticipated demand
 unplanned plant shutdowns
 manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities
 failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 increases in demand on a supplier
 or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors have led
 and may in the future lead
 to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products
 product shortages
 or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets. For example
 we have experienced challenges in meeting strong demand for our incretin products in recent periods
 partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies
 and expect tight supply to persist while additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. Further
 cost and wage inflation
 availability of adequate capacity in global transportation
 supply chain complexities
 including consolidation therein
 labor market issues
 international tension and conflicts
 uneven economic growth or downturns
 an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials
 and public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic
 have caused
 and in the future may cause
 delays or disruptions in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our medicines
 the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity
 procurement activity
 and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements
 as well as other general business impacts. For more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties

Quality Assurance
Our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality requires a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations
 including research and development
 purchasing
 facilities planning
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and dissemination of information about our medicines.
Quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients
 equipment
 facilities
 manufacturing methods
 packaging materials
 and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses
 microbiological testing
 testing in animals
 or a combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers.

 and developing a diverse and highly skilled and ethical workforce
 which is critical to executing our strategy. We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance
 most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists
 and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success.
We are committed to creating a safe

 robust training and development opportunities
 and competitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to promoting diversity
 equity
 and inclusion within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business success and growth.
We regularly conduct confidential employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders to identify opportunities to adjust our policies and benefits to improve our employees' experience. As a result of our efforts
 we believe that we have a highly performing
 cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.
At the end of 2023
 we employed approximately 43
000 people
 including approximately 23
000 employees outside the U.S. Our employees include approximately 10
000 people engaged in research and development activities.
Strategy and Oversight
We are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices
 and we deeply value diverse backgrounds
 skills
 and global perspectives. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance
 our board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract
 retain
 engage
 and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission.
Across all levels of our workforce
 from the end of 2019 through the end of 2023
 we have seen positive changes in representation for minority group members (MGM) in the United States and women globally. In addition

Our recruitment strategy focuses on opportunities to expand our pool of candidates to reach more candidates across a variety of dimensions
 including but not limited to race
 religion

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
•
Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing
 licensing
 or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.
There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development
 the introduction of new products and indications
 business development activities to enhance or refine our product pipeline
 and commercialization of our products.
There is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and development. To bring a product from the discovery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research and development programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data
 the application of pricing controls
 limited scope of approved uses
 label changes
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of newer
 better
 or more cost-effective competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 insufficient infrastructure to support detection
 diagnostic or other requisites for treatment
 ineffectiveness in reaching healthcare professionals
 including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and development resources efficiently
 fail to pursue or invest sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may have been successful
 or fail to optimally balance trial design
 conduct
 and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.
Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay
 uncertainty
 unpredictability
 and inconsistency in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches
 lost market opportunities
 impairment of inventories
 and other negative impacts. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of
 or variability in demand for
 new products and indications
 which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or
 on the other hand
 excess inventory and related financial charges.
We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under development will be approved or launched; whether
 if initially granted
 such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop
 license
 or otherwise acquire additional product candidates
 indications or products; or whether our products and indications
 once launched
 will be commercially successful.
Through internal innovation and business development we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and investments and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls
 lose intellectual property exclusivity
 or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 cash flows
 and financial position. Our dependence on
 or focus in
 one or more key products or product classes may exacerbate this risk. In addition
 the growth of our business and revenue base increases the risk that products developed or acquired by us may not provide adequate value to sustain further long-term growth.
We engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance or refine our product pipeline
 including licensing arrangements
 co-development agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 distribution and promotion agreements
 joint ventures
 acquisitions
 equity investments
 and divestitures. There are
24
24
24
""
""
substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry
 including by the Federal Trade Commission and competition authorities in Europe and other jurisdictions
 and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay
 jeopardize
 or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition
 failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses
 products
 or assets we acquire (including related technology
 commercial operations
 compliance programs
 information security
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to limited diligence opportunities
 unsuccessful clinical trials
 issues related to the quality
 integrity
 or broad applicability of data
 regulatory impediments
 and manufacturing or commercialization challenges. Additionally
 business development activity focused on new modalities may entail additional risks and costs. Accordingly
 business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all)
 may not result in successful development outcomes or successful commercialization of any product
 may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny
 and may result in charges that negatively impact our financial position or results of operations in any given period.

We and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers
 and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and generic pharmaceutical companies and
 in many cases
 our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully
 we must continue to deliver to the market innovative
 cost-effective products through internal innovation or business development that meet important medical needs
 provide improved outcomes for patients
 and deliver value to payers. Our product revenues and prospects are adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are first to market
 have better marketplace access
 have greater brand recognition or are perceived as superior by the marketplace
 by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products
 and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues are also adversely affected by treatment innovations
 including new or superior modalities
 that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.
Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars
 health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. Given the importance to us of marketed biologic products and those in our clinical-stage pipeline
 such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1

Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing
 reimbursement
 and access for our drugs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
 reputation or business.
Public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for
 and patient access to
 our medicines. These pressures have negatively affected
 and could continue to negatively affect
 our consolidated results of operations. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of
 and actions intended to address
 pricing
 reimbursement
 and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical value from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated value. We have experienced increased scrutiny on the pricing of current and potential diabetes
 obesity
 and Alzheimer's products due to payer concern over projected growth in these markets and
 for certain of these drugs
 the anticipated duration of treatment. We have also observed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions.
Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including because of the regulatory priorities of the U.S. presidential administration and regulatory authorities worldwide
 could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example
 in August 2023
 HHS selected Jardiance
 which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim
 as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. Given our product portfolio
 we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years
 which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to exclusivity expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Within the U.S.
 state level transparency initiatives
 importation rules
 reporting requirements
 and mandated programs
 including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state-regulated plans
 have also increased administrative costs
 in some cases
 compromised confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impacted our business. Certain states have also undertaken efforts to codify 340B contract pharmacies into statute which would increase the cost of 340B programs. For more details
 see Item 1
" ""Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing"
 Reimbursement
" and Access."""
Further
 restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 courts
 or private payers
 including in relation to the implementation of the IRA
 reference pricing
 and compulsory licensing
 may adversely impact our business and financial results. We continue to experience additional pricing pressures
 rebates
 clawbacks
 and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic
 periods of uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty
 and the emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 international tension and conflicts.
In addition
 government price reporting and payment regulations are complex
 and require ongoing assessment of the methods by which we calculate and report pricing. Calculation methodologies are inherently subjective and are subject to review and challenge by government agencies. If agencies disagree with our calculations
 or the methodologies and assumptions underlying them
 we may need to restate previously reported data and could be subject to financial and legal liability
 which may be significant. In addition
 changes to calculation methodologies could adversely affect our financial position or consolidated results of operations in any given period.

Pharmaceutical products can develop safety or efficacy concerns
 which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues
 income
 and reputation.
Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of fixed duration and defined populations. After approval and launch
 the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients
 which may lead to identifying new safety or efficacy concerns. We and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. In addition
 we or others (including our competitors
 in some cases) may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. New safety or efficacy data

""
""
from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies of our products or those of our competitors may result in product label changes
 or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. Relatedly
 safety or efficacy concerns raised about a product in the same class or with the same mechanism of action as one of our products or product candidates could be imputed and have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our products or approval of product candidates. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have
 and could in the future
 result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. Safety issues have
 and could in the future
 result in costly product liability claims. Any of these outcomes could result in material financial
 legal
 commercial
 or reputational harm to our business.
•
We derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from relatively few products and sell our products through increasingly consolidated supply chain entities
 which may subject us to
 or exacerbate
 various risks.
We derived direct product and/or alliance revenues of more than $2 billion for each of Trulicity
 Mounjaro
 Verzenio
 Taltz and Jardiance (including Glyxambi
 Synjardy
 and Trijardy XR) that collectively accounted for 63 percent of our total revenues in 2023. In particular
 Trulicity and Mounjaro accounted for 36 percent of our total revenues in 2023 and we expect products with GLP-1 receptor agonist activity
 including the recently launched Zepbound
 to represent a significant and growing portion of our business
 revenues
 and prospects. Loss of patent protection
 changes in prescription rates
 material product liability or pricing litigation
 unexpected side effects or safety concerns
 significant changes in demand
 regulatory proceedings and investigations
 negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence
 pressure from existing or new competitive products
 counterfeit and illegally compounded drugs
 changes in labeling
 pricing
 and insufficient access
 or supply shortages or disruptions for these products or any of our other major products could materially impact our results of operations.
In addition
 in the U.S.
 most of our products are distributed through wholesalers and if one of these significant wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties
 it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us or we might be unable to timely collect the amounts that the wholesaler owes us
 which could negatively impact our results of operations. See Item 1
" ""Business—Marketing and Distribution"
""" for more details. Challenges to U.S. retail pharmacies due to pharmacy benefit manager reimbursement pressures"
 among other things
 have resulted in financial difficulties for some pharmacies that may impact patient experiences
 lead to determinations by certain pharmacies to not carry one or more of our significant products or threaten the viability of these pharmacies
 which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Moreover
 the negotiating power of health plans
 managed care organizations
 pharmacy benefit managers
 and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation
 regulatory
 and other market impacts
 and they
 along with governments
 increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs
 including through the use of formulary inclusion
 or favorable formulary placement. Such stakeholders have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products. As these practices expand
 including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. private third-party payers
 we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Pharmacy benefit manager practices have come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state level who have proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries have on drug pricing and patients’ out of pocket costs. If promulgated
 such legislation could have resultant implications
 costs
 or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
•
We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues
 cash flows
 and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted
 and in the future is likely to continue to result
 in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.
In the ordinary course of their lifecycles
 our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S.
 as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S.
 after a specified period of time. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We have faced
 and remain exposed to
 generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.
For non-biologic products
 loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors
 leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues
 especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies have in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics
 loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e.
 biosimilars) due to many factors
 including development timelines
 manufacturing challenges
 and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approval pathways.
There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover
 patents relating to particular products
 uses
 formulations
 or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by third-parties have also contributed
 and may in the future contribute
 to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them
 or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"
""" and Item 1"
" ""Business—Patents"
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
""" for more details."
Patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process. Given the limited duration of patent and data protection
 the speed with which we develop products
 complete clinical testing
 receive regulatory approval
 supply commercial product to the market
 and obtain public and private payer access are important factors in recouping our development costs and generating financial returns
 particularly given regulatory and market dynamics that have and may continue to put pressure on pricing
 exclusivity periods
 and competition. Delays in achieving these milestones in some cases limits our ability to capitalize on the innovative medicines that we develop or acquire.
•
Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated
 circumvented
 or weakened
 our business will be adversely affected.
Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative medicines. Without strong intellectual property protection
 we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development
 as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market. Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time
 depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws
 regulations
 and enforcement practices could reduce protections for our innovative products and indications. For example
 a proposal by the European Commission to revise the EU's general pharmaceutical legislation threatens the predictability and length of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives
 including by a two-year reduction of data package protection. Changes proposed by the USPTO and by certain bills in Congress to limit the number of
 and differences between
 patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for our products in the U.S.
In addition
 in December 2023
" the U.S. presidential administration released a proposed framework that would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a factor in determining whether it may exercise ""march-in rights"" and license it to a third party to manufacture. A comment period on the proposal runs through February 6"
 2024
 and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be adopted in accordance with the proposed framework.
28
28
28
""
""
Also in the U.S.
 in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA
 which applies to biologic products
 the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering small molecule pharmaceutical products. As a result
 we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products
 including biologics
 will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition
 a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. The USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding the use of discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation. However
 it is not clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings after institution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited review process
 even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent
 our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court
 meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors.
We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful
 such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. In addition
 intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face heightened risks to our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions
 including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products at or relatively shortly after launch. See Item 1
" ""Business—Patents"
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
""" and Item 8"
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies"
""" for more details."
We also face challenges from the distribution of counterfeit and illegally compounded versions of our genuine drugs
 including as related to our products with GLP-1 receptor agonist activity. Counterfeits
 and in some cases illegally compounded drugs
 fraudulently claim to be
 or claim to contain
 genuine branded medicines. Counterfeit and illegally compounded drugs may not have the same safety
 quality
 and effectiveness as approved drugs
 and may pose serious health risks to patients. Our reputation and business could suffer harm from counterfeit or illegally compounded drugs and our actions to stop or prevent illegal sales of such drugs may be costly or ineffective.
Risks Related to Our Operations
•
Failure
 inadequacy
 breach of
 or unauthorized access to
 our IT systems or those of our third-party service providers
 unauthorized access to our confidential information
 or violations of data protection laws
 could each result in material harm to our business and reputation.
Important confidential information owned by us
 our business partners
 or other third parties is stored in our information systems
 networks
 and facilities or those of third parties. This includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property
 clinical trial information
 corporate strategic plans
 marketing plans
 customer information
 and personally identifiable information
 such as employee and patient information (collectively
 confidential information). We also rely
 to a large extent
 on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems
 infrastructure
 cloud technologies
 and hardware (together
 IT systems)
 some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties
 to accumulate

 and availability of our IT systems and confidential information is vital to our business. Our failure
 or the failure of our third-party service providers
 to protect and maintain the security
 confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of our (or their) IT systems and confidential information and other data could significantly harm our reputation as well as result in significant costs
 including those related to fines
 penalties
 litigation
 and obligations to comply with applicable data breach laws.
IT systems are inherently vulnerable to system inadequacies
 inadequate controls or procedures
 operating failures

 we update
 transition
 acquire
 or expand use of our and third-party IT systems
 which may result in heightened vulnerability. Some third-party IT systems that are necessary for the operation of our business processes are maintained outside of our control but would impact business operations if compromised as a result of a cyber-attack. In February 2024
 we completed the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
 which replaced our operating and financial systems
 and we recently began our post-implementation activities. We cannot assure that the ERP system and our post-implementation activities will be free of significant operating failures
 service interruptions
 or creation of additional vulnerabilities. See Item 9A
" ""Controls and Procedures"" for more details. Vulnerabilities"
 inadequacies
 or failures are in many cases more acute for IT systems associated with recently acquired businesses
 and we may be unable to entirely address such vulnerabilities
 inadequacies
 or failures immediately after acquiring a business or ever. As a result
 our newly acquired businesses are in some cases more vulnerable to failures
 interruptions
 breaches
 intrusions
 theft
 exfiltration
 or attacks.
Cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency
 sophistication
 and intensity
 and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect
 mitigate
 or prevent. Cyber-attacks come in many forms
 including the deployment of harmful malware
 exploitation of vulnerabilities (including those of third-party software or systems)
 denial-of-service attacks
 the use of social engineering
 and other means to compromise the confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of IT systems
 confidential information

 current or former company personnel
 and other actors. Our third-party partners
 including third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services
 as well as suppliers
 distributors

 and other third parties with whom we may share data
 face similar risks
 which could affect us directly or indirectly. Unassociated third parties present further risks
 including by propagating misinformation related to our products
 business
 and industry
 including through social media. We and others in the healthcare industry have been and continue to be targets for cyber-attacks
 and the number of threats has increased over time. Numerous federal agencies that monitor and regulate internet and cyber-crime have issued guidance
 alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching
 malicious actors targeting healthcare-related systems and nation-state sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information.

 or paralyze our operations; give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws; require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators; expose us to civil and criminal investigations; and/or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages
 which effects could endure for a long period of time. Unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could further expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world
 subject us to litigation
 and damage public trust in our company. In addition
 IT system security in jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weaker and may result in additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks.
We are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection
 including laws and regulations relating to the collection
 storage
 handling
 use
 disclosure
 transfer
 and security of personal information. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and the subject of significant attention by regulators and private parties globally. Regulators are imposing new data privacy and security requirements
 including new and greater monetary fines or penalties for privacy violations
 and jurisdictions where we operate have passed
 or continue to propose
 data privacy legislation and/or regulations. For example
 we are subject to existing laws in the EU
 United Kingdom
 China
 and U.S.
 all of which provide for substantial penalties for

Manufacturing
 quality
 or supply chain difficulties
 disruptions
 or shortages could lead to product supply problems.
We are in the midst of a significant expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and substantial investment in long-term supply agreements to support current and anticipated demand for our products. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. Manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or those of our contractors and suppliers
 the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 or increases in demand on a supplier with constrained capacity could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing
 distribution
 and sale of our products and/or product shortages
 leading to lost revenue or reduced marked opportunities. In select cases
 supply constraints may also lead to pauses
 discontinuations
 or other product availability issues in one or more markets
 which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations
 cash flows
 and reputation. Further
 cost inflation and global transportation and logistics challenges
 as well as tight labor markets
 have caused
 and in the future may cause
 delays in
 and/or increase costs related to
 distribution of our medicines
 the construction or other acquisition of additional manufacturing capacity
 procurement activity
 and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. These disruptions and challenges could result from actual or perceived quality
 oversight
 or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters (including increased instances or severity of natural disasters or other events that may be due to climate change)
 public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics; periods of uneven economic growth or downturns; emergence or escalation of
 and responses to international tension and conflicts; equipment
 mechanical
 data
 or IT system vulnerabilities
 such as system inadequacies
 inadequate controls or procedures
 operating failures
 unauthorized access
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 theft
 exfiltration
 ransomware or other cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; labor shortages; challenges and complexities in manufacturing new drug modalities; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; vertical integration by competitors within our supply chain; or inability to obtain single-source or other raw or intermediate materials. Regional or single source dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and supply. For example
 we
 and the pharmaceutical industry generally
 depend on China-based partners for integral chemical synthesis
 reagents
 starting materials
 and ingredients. Finding alternative suppliers if and as necessary due to geopolitical developments or otherwise may not be feasible or could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of our products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals which would cause disruptions to patients and detrimentally impact our business.
Difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted
 and in the future may result
 in difficulty meeting demand
 or disruptions
 shortages
 and higher costs in the supply of
 our products. For example
 we have experienced challenges
31
31
31
""
""
in meeting demand for our incretin products in recent periods
 partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies
 and expect tight supply to persist while additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. Despite our ongoing efforts to meet significant expected demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity
 there can be no assurances that such capacity increases will be realized as expected. Delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity would limit our ability to capitalize on demand for our products. Conversely
 unexpected events that limit demand for our products would undermine our ability to realize the full benefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred
 and expect to continue to incur
 to augment manufacturing capacity and may also subject us to contractual payment obligations
 which may be significant. The foregoing risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and reputation. See Item 1
" ""Business—Raw Materials and Product Supply"
""" and Item 7"
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition and Liquidity"" for more details."
•
Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.
We rely on third parties
 including suppliers
 distributors
 alliances
 and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
 and third-party service providers
 for selected aspects of product and clinical development
 manufacturing
 commercialization
 hosting of
 and support for
 IT systems
 product distribution
 and certain financial transactional processes. As examples
 we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations
 certain active ingredient manufacturing
 finishing operations
 and device or component production and assembly to contract manufacturing organizations
 and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. In some cases
 product or indication approvals depend on the outcome of regulatory inspections of third parties on which we rely. For example
 in September 2023
 the FDA issued a complete response letter for our lebrikizumab BLA for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In the letter
 the FDA cited findings that arose during a multi-sponsor inspection of a third-party
 contract manufacturing organization that included the monoclonal antibody drug substance for lebrikizumab. We may encounter similar difficulties in the future
 which could delay or prevent product launches and otherwise negatively affect our business
 results
 and reputation.
Outsourcing involves many risks
 including the risk that third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements
 including applicable requirements for diversity in clinical trials; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us
 our clinical trial subjects
 or patients; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to IT system vulnerabilities
 such as inadequacies
 inadequate controls or procedures
 operating failures
 unauthorized access
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 theft
 exfiltration
 ransomware or other cyber-attacks; may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in which case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing; or may fail to perform at all. The foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the U.S.
 where we may have fewer alternative providers as well as face additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks. Failure of third parties to meet their contractual
 regulatory
 confidentiality
 privacy
 security
 or other obligations to us
 our clinical trial subjects
 and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business.
•
Our use of artificial intelligence (AI) or other emerging technologies could adversely impact our business and financial results.
We have begun to deploy AI and other emerging technologies in various facets of our operations and we continue to explore further use cases for AI. The rapid advancement of these technologies presents opportunities for us in research
 manufacturing
 commercialization
 and other business endeavors but also entails risks
 including that AI-generated content
 analyses
 or recommendations we utilize could be deficient
 that our competitors may more quickly or effectively adopt AI capabilities
 or that our use of AI or other emerging technologies exacerbates regulatory
 cybersecurity and other significant risks.
Effective development
 management
 and use of AI technologies is novel and complex
 and there are technical challenges associated with achieving desired levels of accuracy
 efficiency
 and reliability. The algorithms and models utilized in AI systems may have limitations
 including biases
 errors
 or inability to handle certain data types or scenarios or to render explainable outputs. Furthermore
 there are risks associated with the fact that the platforms providing AI models are in many cases owned and operated by emerging companies with less contractual and compliance sophistication. These factors may undermine
32
32
32
""
""
our ability to effectively utilize AI or create competitive disadvantages should our competitors more skillfully make use of AI capabilities. Further
 if we are unable to effectively manage the use of AI technologies by our employees
 our confidential information
 intellectual property
 or reputation could be put at risk.
The emergence of AI and other technologies
 particularly generative AI
 may exacerbate other risks
 including those related to regulation
 litigation
 compliance issues
 ethical concerns
 confidentiality
 and data privacy or security. For example
 regulatory uncertainty related to AI or other emerging technologies may require significant resources to adjust business practices to comply with developing laws. Several governmental authorities have already proposed or enacted laws and other guidance governing AI
 such as the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act. These and other developing obligations may prevent or make it harder for us to conduct or enhance our business using AI
 or lead to regulatory fines
 penalties
 or other liability. Further
 use of AI technologies could lead to unintended consequences
 such as cybersecurity risks or unintended biases
 impact our ability to protect our confidential data and intellectual property
 and expose us to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.
Risks Related to Doing Business Internationally
•
Uneven economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions
 geopolitical tensions
 or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products
 affecting our sales. Declining tax revenues and increased government spending on other programs attributable to uneven economic growth or downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending
 leading to increased control of drug prices or lower utilization. Additionally
 some customers
 including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding and cash-pay patients
 may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner. Also
 if our customers
 suppliers
 or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties
 we could experience slower customer collections
 greater bad debt expense
 and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. Similarly
 uneven economic growth or downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets.
In addition
 significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe
 Asia
 and other international geographies. Trade and other global disputes and interruptions
 including related to tariffs
 trade protection measures
 import or export licensing requirements
 the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments
 international tension and conflicts
 as well as cost inflation
 strains on global transportation
 manufacturing
 and labor markets
 and public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic
 affect our ability to do business. For example
 tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland
 as well as other business restrictions. If geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt our operations in
 or related to
 China
 such disruption would significantly impact our business. As a further example
 the financial impact of higher energy prices
 defense spending
 and inflation due
 in part
 to geopolitical and economic disruptions
 has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments with single-payer or government funded healthcare systems
 leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates
 clawbacks
 and other reforms to reimbursement systems
 particularly in Europe. These and similar events have adversely affected
 and may continue to adversely affect
 us
 our business partners
 and our customers. For more details

In addition to developments related to our business or financial results
 or those of our competitors
 uneven economic growth
 downturns
 or other negative global developments
 could also undermine our growth or result in significant and sudden declines in the trading price of our common stock and market capitalization.
•
Changes in foreign currency rates
 interest rate risks
 and inflation affect our results of operations.
As a global company
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates
 and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions
 each of which impacts our results of operations. In recent periods
 significant fluctuations in currency rates and inflation have impacted our results of operations. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies
 and our results of operations are
33

33
""
""
adversely impacted when the U.S. dollar is strong compared to foreign currencies. Further
 in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency in a particular market in which we operate
 the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. Inflationary pressures in recent periods have also negatively impacted us and may continue to negatively impact us in various ways
 including cost inflation
 higher labor costs
 and other higher expenses
 with some of these higher expenses due in part to policy actions intended to curb inflation. See Item 7

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Litigation
•
We face litigation and investigations related to our products
 how we price or commercialize our products
 and other aspects of our business
 which could adversely affect our business
 and we are self-insured for such matters.
We are subject to a substantial number of claims involving various current and historical products
 litigation
 and investigations. These claims relate to how we commercialize and/or how we price our products
 including relating to our 340B drug pricing program
 product safety
 as well as contractual matters and other disputes. See Item 8
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies"" for more information on our current product liability litigation"
 as well as pricing and other litigation
 investigations
 and inquiries. Like many companies in our industry
 from time to time investigations into aspects of our business include inquiries
 subpoenas
 and other types of information demands from government and regulatory authorities. There continues to be a significant volume of government and regulatory investigations and litigation against companies operating in our industry
 as well as increasingly robust regulatory enforcement. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products
 we are
 and could in the future become
 subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our previous
 current
 or future products
 or to further litigation or investigations
 including related to product safety and pricing or other commercial practices. Some of these matters involve numerous plaintiffs and parties seeking large or indeterminate financial claims and may remain unresolved for several years. Such matters could negatively impact our reputation
 affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and
 if involving marketed products
 could adversely affect sales of the product and our consolidated results of operations in any given period. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance
 we are predominately self-insured for litigation liability losses for all of our currently marketed products
 as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters.
•
We are subject to evolving and complex tax laws
 which may result in additional liabilities and affect our results of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions
 and in the course of our business
 we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events. Changes in tax laws
 regulations
 administrative practices
 principles
 disclosure obligations
 and interpretations
 as well as events that differ from our expectations
 have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates
 cash flows
 and/or results of operations. In addition
 tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of cross-border tax issues
 which could unfavorably impact our results of operations. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate
 such as the recent enactments by both the EU and non-EU countries of a global minimum tax. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Tax Matters"" and Item 8"
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14: Income Taxes"
""" for more details."
•
Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.
""
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation. Many companies
 including us
 are and have been subject to investigations
 litigation
 and claims related to these practices asserted by governmental authorities and
34
34
34
""
""
other parties. These investigations
 litigation
 and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences. The final outcomes of such investigations
 litigation
 and claims include criminal charges and fines
 penalties
 or other monetary or non-monetary remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. Such investigations
 litigation
 and claims have intensified and may continue to intensify as a result of evolving U.S. and foreign regulatory priorities. New business practices or commercial capabilities may subject us to additional scrutiny over compliance with applicable regulatory schemes and compliance obligations or expose us to new regulatory schemes and compliance obligations entirely. In addition
 regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP
 quality assurance
 evolving standards
 and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines
 and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 and reputational harm
 any of which adversely affects our business. Regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment and interpretation
 which can result in inconsistent administration of laws and regulations by health authorities. Regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may be particularly unpredictable and result in additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks.U.S. and foreign governmental authorities are actively promulgating additional regulations that impact many aspects of our operations. These regulations are in some cases advanced with short notice. New regulations may undermine our ability to achieve business objectives
 may be costly to implement
 may provide only limited time for compliance
 may change accounting and reporting standards
 and may carry significant penalties for non-compliance. See Item 1
" ""Business—Government Regulation of Our Operations"
""" for more details."
Furthermore
 there is an increased focus by foreign
 federal
 state
 and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change
 regulating greenhouse gas emissions
 carbon taxes
 emissions trading schemes
 sustainability
 human rights and equity matters
 and disclosure regarding the foregoing
 many of which may be ambiguous
 inconsistent
 dynamic or conflicting. We expect to experience increased restrictions and compliance costs
 legal costs
 and expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements. Moreover
 compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements would require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters. In addition
 we may still be subject to penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices.
Additionally
 we are subject to increased negative attention from the media
 stockholders
 activists
 and other stakeholders on climate change
 social
 and sustainability matters. The perception that we have failed to act in a socially responsible manner
 whether or not valid
 results in adverse publicity that can negatively affect our business
 brand
 and reputation
 as well as result in increased scrutiny from legislators and regulatory authorities. Moreover
 from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments
 including to reduce our impact on the environment. Our ability to achieve any stated environmental
 social or governance goal
 target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions
 many of which are outside our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements
 the availability of requisite financing
 and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other goals. If we fail to achieve
 are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving
 or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments
 it could negatively affect our reputation
 brand
 or investor confidence
 and expose us to enforcement actions and litigation.

Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
We manage cybersecurity threats as part of our oversight
 evaluation
 and mitigation of enterprise-level risks. We have based our cybersecurity program on industry frameworks with the goal of building enterprise resilience against an evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and to respond to cybersecurity threats as they materialize. Our program includes monitoring
 identification
 assessment
 and management components
 as well as information and escalation components designed to inform management and the board of directors of prospective risks and developments.
Our information security program encompasses functions dedicated to both proactive and reactive management of cybersecurity threats. We implement our cybersecurity program internally through established policies
 standards
 reference architectures
 and the use of enterprise security services that focus on emerging and ongoing cybersecurity risks. Our proactive management of cybersecurity risks entails many actions
 including the maintenance of system access restrictions
 utilization of data security technology
 employee education and training initiatives
 and retention of cyber liability insurance
 among other measures. We regularly engage third-party auditors and consultants and leverage our internal audit function to assess various facets of our cybersecurity program. These engagements include completion of industry-standard assessments or certifications
 maturity model reviews
 threat simulations
 as well as internal reviews to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity processes. We also maintain enterprise-wide processes to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers. As examples
 we generally review current and prospective third-party service providers for unacceptable cybersecurity risks
 negotiate contractual provisions that require the establishment of third-party cybersecurity controls
 and deploy communications security measures to protect third-party communications.
We assess cybersecurity contingencies within our overall business continuity risk management planning process. Our Information Security team utilizes various tools to prevent
 detect
 monitor
 and react to cybersecurity threats. Our Incident Response Playbook outlines processes
 roles
 responsibilities
 engagements
 escalations
 notifications
 and other communications applicable to the assessment
 mitigation
 and remediation of realized cybersecurity events. The nature and assessed risk of a realized cybersecurity event dictates the pace and extent of relevant processes
 escalations
 and communications
 including an evaluation of any necessary or required disclosure. Roles and escalation paths range from within the Information Security team up to the Executive Committee
 and the board of directors and its committees
 as appropriate.
We describe risks faced by us from identified cybersecurity threats in Item 1A

Governance
Management
 under the supervision of our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
 is directly responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and otherwise implementing our cybersecurity program
 which includes our Incident Response Playbook. The CISO reports directly to our Chief Information and Digital Officer (CIDO)
 who is a member of our Executive Committee and leads our information technology
 cybersecurity
 digital health
 and advanced analytics and data science functions. Our CIDO in turn regularly updates our Executive Committee on cybersecurity matters. Our CISO and CIDO have significant experience managing global cybersecurity threats across the pharmaceutical
 technology
 entertainment
 and defense industries. In addition to providing regular updates to the CIDO and his staff
 the CISO is a member of our Executive Information Security Governance function (EISG)
 which meets regularly and is also composed of executive and senior leadership from a variety of functions
 including information security
 legal
 finance
 audit
 and ethics and compliance to assess and manage cybersecurity developments and risks and our internal programs. Each of the CIDO
 the CISO and the EISG may call upon business and legal stakeholders across our company to manage cybersecurity threats and incidents.
The audit committee of our board of directors is responsible for oversight of the company's programs
 policies
 procedures
 and risk management activities related to information security and data protection. The audit committee meets regularly with our CIDO and CISO to discuss threats
 risks
 and ongoing efforts to enhance cyber resiliency
 as well as changes to the broader cybersecurity landscape. In addition
 the ethics and compliance committee supports the audit committee and board in oversight of legal and regulatory compliance. Our board of directors also regularly participates in presentations on cybersecurity and information technology. In addition to regular presentations
 management promptly updates our board of directors regarding significant threats and incidents as they arise.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock Index and our peer group for the years 2019 through 2023. The graph assumes that
 on the last business day of 2018
 a person invested $100 each in Lilly stock
 the S&P 500 Stock Index
 and the peer group's collective common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return
 which takes into account both stock price and dividends. It assumes that dividends paid by a company are immediately reinvested in that company's stock.

Revenue increased in 2023 driven by increased volume and higher realized prices. The increase in revenue in 2023 was primarily driven by sales of Mounjaro

""
 Verzenio
®
""
 and Jardiance
®
""
 as well as the sales of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio
 including Zyprexa
®
""
 and for Baqsimi
®
""
 partially offset by the absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and lower sales of Alimta
®
following the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022.
Net income and earnings per share decreased in 2023
 driven primarily by higher acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges and increased research and development expenses
 marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses
 and income taxes
 partially offset by increased revenue.

Late-Stage Pipeline
Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative medicines. We currently have approximately 50 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review
 and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase.
The following select new molecular entities (NMEs) and new indication line extension (NILEX) products are currently in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review or have recently received regulatory approval in the United States (U.S.)
 European Union (EU)
 or Japan. The table reflects the status of these NMEs and NILEX products
 including certain other developments
 up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development
 the introduction of new products and indications
 business development activities to enhance or refine or product pipeline
 and commercialization of our products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and development. To bring a product from the discovery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research and development programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data
 the application of pricing controls
 limited scope of approved uses
 label changes
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of newer
 better
 or more cost-effective competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 insufficient infrastructure to support detection
 diagnostic or other requisites for treatment
 ineffectiveness in reaching healthcare professionals
 including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and development resources efficiently
 fail to pursue or invest sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may have been successful
 or fail to optimally balance trial design
 conduct
 and speed to accomplish desired outcomes. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay
 uncertainty
 unpredictability
 and inconsistency in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches
 lost market opportunities
 impairment of inventories
 and other negative impacts. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of
 or variability in demand for
 new products and indications which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or
 on the other hand
 excess inventory and related financial charges.

""
""
We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications. A delay in
 or termination of
 any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process
 we cannot reliably estimate the nature
 timing
 and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects
 nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline
 and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes
 we must make significant cost estimations and allocations
 some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore
 we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project
 by preclinical versus clinical spend
 or by therapeutic category.
Other Matters
Patent Matters
We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue
 cash flows
 and earnings.
See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents.
See Item 1
" ""Business—Patents"
 Trademarks
" and Other Intellectual Property Rights"" for additional discussion of the impacts of trends involving intellectual property on our business and results."
Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
Reforms
 including those that may stem from political initiatives
 periods of uneven economic growth or downturns
 or as a result of high inflation
 the emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 international tension and conflicts
 or government budgeting priorities
 are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
Global concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action
 as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts
 price reporting requirements
 mandated reference prices
 restrictive formularies
 changes to available intellectual property protections
 as well as other efforts. In August 2022
 the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures
 the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally
 these government prices apply nine years (for medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) following initial FDA approval and will be set at a price that is likely to represent a significant discount from existing average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a ceiling price
 it does not set a minimum or floor price. In August 2023
 the HHS selected Jardiance
 which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim
 as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. Given our product portfolio
 we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years
 which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.
Other IRA provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also
 the Part D benefit redesign will replace the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties
 including civil monetary penalties
 which could be significant.
The IRA has and will meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular
 the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a new drug application reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The IRA can cause changes to development approach and timing and investments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry
 including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting
 remains uncertain.

Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress
 the U.S. executive branch
 and regulatory authorities worldwide
 could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.
Consolidation and integration of private payors and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore
 restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 courts
 or private payers may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products
 which could adversely affect our business. In addition
 we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340B program
 access to insulin
 pricing
 product safety
 and other matters that
 if resolved adversely to us
 could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.
In addition
 regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices
 quality assurance
 safety signals
 evolving standards
 and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines
 and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 inability to realize the benefit of capital expenditures
 or delays or denials in new product approvals
 line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 or other negative impacts
 any of which result in reputational harm or adversely affect our business. Moreover
 increased focus on business combinations across industries and jurisdictions can lead to impediments to the completion of business combinations.

Product Supply
We have faced challenges
 and expect to continue to face challenges
 meeting strong demand for our incretin products. In the U.S.
 given the strong uptake of Mounjaro
 the recent launch of Zepbound
 and continuing demand for Trulicity
®
""
 we have experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain orders for incretin products. Outside the U.S.
 we have implemented actions to manage demand amid tight supply
 including measures to minimize impact to existing Trulicity patients. We have also progressed efforts to bring tirzepatide to patients via different delivery presentations outside the U.S.
 such as single-use vials and multi-use pens. We expect to continue to experience disruptions in our supply of incretin products and for demand and supply considerations to influence the timing of tirzepatide launches in new markets
 if approved.
We anticipate tight supplies of our incretin products will persist while additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. We expect additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity will become fully operational around the world in the next several years as part of our ongoing efforts to meet the significant demand for our incretin medicines. For example
 in 2023 we began production at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina and expect to continue significant capacity expansion over time as we increase production at this site and others.
Tax Matters
We are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore
 changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to increase their scrutiny of cross-border tax issues. Changes to existing U.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

In response to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Framework)
 which set forth a two-pillar solution to reform the international tax framework
" and the EU's adoption of Directive 2022/2523 (known as ""Pillar Two"") (Directive) within the EU to implement the Framework"
 multiple countries
 both within and outside of the EU
 have enacted legislation that provides for a minimum level of taxation of multinational companies. The Directive required EU member states to enact legislation effective for years beginning on or after December 31
 2023. For certain provisions within the Framework
 the OECD published guidance during 2023 that extends the effective dates for enactment. While we expect an increase in future years’ tax expense as a result of the global minimum tax
 we do not anticipate a material impact to our 2024 consolidated results of operations. Our assessment of the impact for 2024 and subsequent years could be affected by legislative guidance
 future enactment of additional provisions within the Pillar Two framework
 and U.S. tax changes scheduled to occur in 2026 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act).
A bipartisan tax bill
 the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act
 was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in January 2024. The bill contains certain business tax provisions including the retroactive repeal for 2022 and 2023 and deferral of the requirement to capitalize U.S. research and development expenses for tax purposes that was a provision enacted in the 2017 Tax Act. Uncertainty exists as to whether the bill will be enacted into law; however
 if the bill is enacted as currently drafted
 we would expect our effective tax rate for 2024 to be moderately higher
 and a net discrete tax detriment in the quarter of enactment related to 2022 and 2023. In addition
 we would expect a decrease in cash tax payments.
Acquisitions
We invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including acquisitions
 collaborations
 investments
 and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance or refine our pipeline and strengthen our business.
For investments that were accounted for as asset acquisitions
 we paid $3.94 billion in 2023 for acquired IPR&D primarily related to acquisitions of DICE
 Versanis
 Emergence Therapeutics AG (Emergence)
 and Mablink Biosciences SAS (Mablink). For investments that were accounted for as business combinations
 we paid $1.04 billion in 2023 primarily related to the acquisition of POINT Biopharma Global Inc. (POINT).
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.
For discussion of risks related to business development activities
 see Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors—Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing"
 licensing
" or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies."""
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
As a global company
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro
 Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques
 significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact
 either positive or negative
 on our consolidated results of operations in any given period. There is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign currency exchange rates
 and fluctuations in these rates could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
Other Factors
Other factors have had
 and may continue to have
 an impact on our consolidated results of operations. These factors include cost and wage inflation
 availability of adequate capacity in global transportation
 supply chain and labor market complexities
 international tension and conflicts
 uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty
 and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials.

 and Zepbound and $579.0 million from the sale of the rights for Baqsimi
 partially offset by the absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and decreased volume from Alimta following the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022. In the U.S. the higher realized prices in 2023 were primarily driven by Mounjaro
 due to decreased utilization of savings card programs as access continued to expand
 partially offset by Trulicity
 due to higher contracted rebates and unfavorable segment mix
 as well as changes to estimates for rebates and discounts

 primarily due to a one-time impact related to the implementation of list price decreases and unfavorable segment mix.
Outside the U.S. the increase in volume in 2023 was primarily driven by $1.45 billion from the sale of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio
 including Zyprexa
 as well as increased volume for Verzenio and Jardiance. Outside the U.S. the lower realized prices in 2023 were primarily driven by a new supply arrangement associated with the sale of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio and lower realized prices from Trulicity
 Verzenio

Revenue of Trulicity decreased 4 percent in the U.S.
 driven by lower realized prices due to higher contracted rebates and unfavorable segment mix
 as well as changes to estimates for rebates and discounts
 partially offset by increased demand. We have experienced and continue to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of Trulicity. These delays have impacted and are expected to continue to impact volume. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent
 primarily driven by lower realized prices
 partially offset by increased volume. Volumes in international markets continue to be affected by actions we have taken to manage demand amid tight supply
 including measures to minimize impact to existing patients.

NM - not meaningful
Gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2023 increased 2.4 percentage points compared with 2022
 primarily driven by the absence of COVID-19 antibodies sales in 2023
 higher realized prices
 and the sales of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi
 partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion.
Research and development expenses increased 30 percent in 2023
 primarily driven by development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research.
Marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in 2023
 primarily driven by costs associated with launches of new products and indications
 as well as compensation and benefits costs.
Acquired IPR&D charges recognized in 2023 primarily related to acquisitions of DICE
 Versanis
 Emergence
 and Mablink and from a business development transaction with Beam Therapeutics Inc. Acquired IPR&D charges recognized in 2022 included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review Voucher. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges recognized in 2022 primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for GBA1 Gene Therapy due to changes in estimated launch timing. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Other—net
 (income) expense included net investment losses on equity securities of $20.2 million and $410.7 million for the years ended 2023 and 2022
 respectively. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our effective tax rate was 20.1 percent in 2023
 compared with an effective tax rate of 8.3 percent in 2022. The higher effective tax rate for 2023 was primarily driven by the tax impacts of non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges
 the new Puerto Rico tax regime
 and a lower net discrete tax benefit compared to 2022.

Operating Results—2022
For a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2022 and 2021 see Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31"
 2022.
""
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
We believe our available cash and cash equivalents
 together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings
 are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements
 which include:
•
working capital requirements
 including related to employee payroll and benefits
 clinical trials
 manufacturing materials
 and taxes;
•
capital expenditures;
•
share repurchases and dividends;
•
repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;
•
milestone and royalty payments;
•
potential business development activities
 including acquisitions
 collaborations
 investments
 and licensing arrangements; and
•
contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans.
Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources
 including our access to external capital
 to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31
 2023
 our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations
 capital expenditures
 dividends
 repayment of outstanding borrowings
 milestone and royalty payments
 business development activities
 and the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act
 (see Notes 11
 4
 3
 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.
Capital expenditures were $3.45 billion during 2023
 compared to $1.85 billion in 2022. We are making investments in new facilities in Indiana
 North Carolina
 Alzey
 Rhineland-Palatinate
 Germany
 and Limerick
 Ireland to manufacture existing and future products. These investments
 and other capital investments that support our operations
 have increased our capital expenditures and will result in higher capital expenditures over the next several years.
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.82 billion as of December 31
 2023
 compared with $2.07 billion at December 31
 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $4.24 billion in 2023
 compared with $7.59 billion in 2022. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in cash payments for income taxes. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31
 2023 and 2022.
In addition to our cash and cash equivalents
 we held total investments of $3.16 billion and $3.05 billion as of December 31
 2023 and 2022
 respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In 2023
 we received cash proceeds of $1.60 billion for the sale of product rights
 primarily related to the sales of the rights for the olanzapine portfolio
 including Zyprexa
 and Baqsimi. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
For investments that were accounted for as asset acquisitions
 we paid $3.94 billion in 2023 for acquired IPR&D primarily related to acquisitions of DICE
 Versanis
 Emergence
 and Mablink. For investments that were accounted for as business combinations
 we paid $1.04 billion in 2023 primarily related to the acquisition of POINT. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As of December 31
 2023
 total debt was $25.23 billion
 an increase of $8.99 billion compared with $16.24 billion at December 31
 2022. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In February 2024
 we issued $1.00 billion of 4.500 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2027
 $1.00 billion of 4.500 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2029
 $1.50 billion of 4.700 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2034
 $1.50 billion of 5.000 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2054
 and $1.50 billion of 5.100 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2064
 all with interest to be paid semi-annually. We used
 or will be using
 the net cash proceeds from the offering of $6.45 billion for general business purposes
 including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper
 repayment of current maturities of long-term debt
 and repayment of the $750.0 million of 5.000 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2026
 which are callable at par beginning February 27
 2024.
As of December 31
 2023
 we had a total of $7.42 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities
 $7.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.
Dividends of $4.52 per share and $3.92 per share were paid in 2023 and 2022
 respectively. The quarterly dividend was increased to $1.30 per share effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2024
 resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2024 of $5.20 per share.
In 2023
 we repurchased $750.0 million of shares under our $5.00 billion share repurchase program that our board authorized in May 2021. As of December 31
 2023
 we had $2.50 billion remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
"See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"" for information regarding losses of patent protection."
Both domestically and abroad
 we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment and international tension and conflicts; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers
 including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international government funding levels.
In the normal course of business
 our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates
 currency values
 and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations impact the costs of financing
 investing
 and operating our business. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.
Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures
 we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and in some cases we enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31
 2023
 all of our total long-term debt is at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 12 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31
 2023 and 2022
 including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments
 a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31
 2023 and 2022
 respectively
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.

""
Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro
 Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We in some cases enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro
 Chinese yuan
 and Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset
 in part
 the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31
 2023 and 2022
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.
Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31
 2023 and 2022
 our carrying values of these investments were $1.32 billion and $1.16 billion
 respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net
 (income) expense by $263.9 million and $232.4 million as of December 31
 2023 and 2022
 respectively.
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures
 or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g.
 approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement
 we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained.
Individually
 these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However
 if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period
 the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows
 respectively
 in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product
 which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however
 we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.
As we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our incretin products
 we have entered
 and expect to continue to enter
 into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could
 under certain circumstances
 require us to pay up to approximately $10 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services over the durations of the agreements
 which generally range from 2 to 8 years.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses
 and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex
 and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make
 it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that
 given current facts and circumstances
 it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations
 financial position
 or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Return
 Rebate
 and Discount Accruals
Background and Uncertainties
We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts
 product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers
 provisions for returns
 rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer
 we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 and chargeback programs
 as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs
 in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount
 we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs
 as well as patient assistance program costs
 by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g.
 patent expiries and product launches)
 an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs
 the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs
 and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale
 the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag
 in any particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.
Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return
 rebate
 and discount accruals.
Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations
 as well as royalties
 upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.
Financial Statement Impact
We believe that our accruals for sales returns
 rebates
 and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31
 2023
 a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $615 million.
The portion of our consolidated sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31
 2023 and 2022.
The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability balances
 including managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 chargeback
 and patient assistance programs:

 and Medicaid programs.
Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies
Background and Uncertainties
Litigation liabilities and other contingencies are
 by their nature
 uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation
 the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters
 the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation
 as applicable
 and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions
 if any. In addition
 we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage.
We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage
 we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions
 the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company
 the financial condition of the insurers
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance
 we are predominantly self-insured for liability losses for all our currently and previously marketed products
 as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters. In addition to insurance coverage
 we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights
 these considerations include the nature of the indemnification
 the financial condition of the indemnifying party
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection.
The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets
 respectively
 on our consolidated balance sheets.
Acquisitions
Background and Uncertainties
To determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition
 we make certain judgments
 which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules.
If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets
 where applicable
 is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business
 the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and
 therefore
 any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to acquired IPR&D on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date
 and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
 as well as estimated asset lives
 can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets
 including acquired IPR&D
 are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include
 but are not limited to
 probability of technical success
 revenue projections
 and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances
 we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.
"The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis
 as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments
 including
 but not limited to
 probability of technical success
 timing of the potential milestone event
 and the discount rate.

Financial Statement Impact
As of December 31
 2023
 a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $5.2 million.
Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets
Background and Uncertainties
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified
 a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value
 and the cost basis is adjusted.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually
 or more frequently if impairment indicators are present
 by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount
 a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.
Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D
" all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
For acquired IPR&D assets
 the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product
" as discussed previously in ""—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such"
 it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.
Estimates of future cash flows
 based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections
 require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
Retirement Benefits Assumptions
Background and Uncertainties
Defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate
 expected return on plan assets
 and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below
 see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.
Annually
 we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined
 plan-specific yield curve of high quality
 fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets
 we consider many factors
 with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions
 asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments)
 and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results
 as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies
 where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption
 we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.
Annually
 we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 48 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively
 alternative investments). We value these alternative investments primarily using net asset values (NAVs) reported by the counterparty and adjusted for known cash flows and significant events.

Financial Statement Impact
If the 2023 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by $13.4 million. If the 2023 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by $31.3 million. If our assumption regarding the 2023 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year
 our income before income taxes would be affected by $35.1 million. The U.S. plans
 including Puerto Rico
 represent approximately 80 percent for total projected benefit obligation and 85 percent for total plan assets at December 31
 2023.
Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred
 along with other actuarial gains and losses
 and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.
Income Taxes
Background and Uncertainties
We file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations
 and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities
 which could result in future tax
 interest
 and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law
 the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities
 new information obtained during a tax examination
 or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets
 primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses
 tax credits
 and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets
 we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.
Financial Statement Impact
As of December 31
 2023
 a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $88.7 million and $45.7 million
 respectively.
