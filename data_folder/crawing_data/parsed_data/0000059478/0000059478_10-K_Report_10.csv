"Eli Lilly and Company (the “company” or “registrant” or ""Lilly"") was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis"
 Indiana
 in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover
 develop
 manufacture
 and market products in a single business segment—human pharmaceutical products.
Our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world. Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists
 and our success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover or acquire
 develop
 and bring to market innovative new medicines.
In September 2018 Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco)
 an animal health business previously wholly owned by the company
 completed an initial public offering of its common stock
 which trades on the New York Stock Exchange
 and in March 2019
 we completed the disposition of our remaining ownership of Elanco common stock. For more information on the exchange offer
 see Item 7
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview”.
We manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the United States (U.S.)

Marketing
We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs.
U.S.
In the U.S.
 most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies
 physicians and other health care professionals
 and hospitals. In
2019

""
2018
""
 and
2017
""
 three wholesale distributors in the U.S. - McKesson Corporation
 AmerisourceBergen Corporation
 and Cardinal Health
 Inc. - each accounted for between
14 percent
and
21 percent
of our consolidated total revenue. No other distributor accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated total revenue in any of those years.
We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals. We also promote to healthcare providers in medical journals and on-line health care channels
 distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians
 and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition
 we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S.
 and we maintain websites with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our own resources.
We maintain special business groups to service wholesalers
 pharmacy benefit managers
 managed care organizations
 group purchasing organizations
 government and long-term care institutions
 hospitals
 and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products.

Outside the U.S.
 we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and on-line health care channels. While the products marketed vary from country to country
 diabetes and other endocrinology products constitute the largest single group in consolidated revenue. Distribution patterns vary from country to country. In most countries in which we operate
 we maintain our own sales organizations
 but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors.
Marketing Collaborations
Certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies
 including the following:

Competition
Our products compete globally with products of many other companies in highly competitive markets.
Important competitive factors include effectiveness
 safety
 and ease of use; price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products
 processes
 and uses. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. If competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages
 our products can be subject to decreased sales
 progressive price reductions
 or both.
We believe our long-term competitive success depends upon discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative
 cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes and deliver value to payers
 and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products
 and it is possible that our products will be
 or become
 uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors.
Generic Pharmaceuticals
One of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S. and Europe
 the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy
 allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. Therefore
 generic manufacturers generally invest far less than we do in research and development and can price their products much lower than our branded products. Accordingly
 when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity
 it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. Public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow
 and in many cases require
 pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory
 it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In many countries outside the U.S.
 intellectual property protection is weak
 and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products.
Biosimilars
Several of our current products
 including Cyramza
 Emgality
 Erbitux
 Taltz
 and Trulicity and many of the new molecular entities (NMEs) in our research pipeline are biologics. Competition for Lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics
 also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that
 due to its functional and structural similarity to the innovator biologic
 is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Globally
 most governments have developed regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as alternatives to innovator-developed biologics
 but the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. The extent to which a biosimilar
 once approved
 will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for
7
7
""
""
non-biologic products
 is not yet entirely clear
 and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing.
Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. For example
 a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro which competes with our product Humalog. On the other hand
 with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim
 we developed Basaglar
 a new insulin glargine product
 which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a follow-on biologic in the U.S.
 and as a biosimilar in Europe and Japan. In March 2020
 the U.S. regulatory status of all of our insulin products will transition to become regulated as “biologics” rather than “drugs.” Based on recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance
 this change may lower the requirements for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market
 some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at U.S. pharmacies.
U.S. Private Sector Dynamics
In the U.S. private sector
 consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer
 larger entities
 thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. For example
 in 2018 CVS Health
 a large pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy chain
 acquired Aetna
 a large national insurer
 and Cigna Corporation acquired Express Scripts in a similar transaction. More recently
 in December 2019
 Express Scripts signed a three-year partnership agreement with another pharmacy benefit manager
 Prime Therapeutics.
Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions
 such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions
 or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost
 such as non-preferred co-pay tiers
 increased co-insurance levels
 and higher deductibles. Consequently
 pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy
 safety profile
 or patient ease of use
 but also by providing rebates. Value-based agreements
 where pricing is based on achievement
 or not
 of specified outcomes
 are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions
 particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures are expected to continue to negatively affect our future consolidated results of operations.
Patents
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Overview
Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines. We own
 have applied for
 or are licensed under
 a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products
 product uses
 formulations
 and manufacturing processes. In addition
 as discussed below
 for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.
The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent)
 particularly those in major markets such as the U.S.
 various European countries
 and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications
 usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the Discovery Phase of the drug discovery process
 which is described in the “Research and Development” section below. In general
 national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application
 which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:

""
process
 a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration
 and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. also offer forms of patent term restoration. For example
 Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Similarly
 in Japan
 South Korea
 and Australia
 patent terms can be extended up to five years
 depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors.
Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals
 especially for non-biologic products
 typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product
 which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However
 in some cases the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic
 biosimilar
 or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets
 later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes
 methods of use or formulations
 or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:
Outside the major markets
 the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely
 and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization
 more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement. Thus
 some types of patents
 such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules
 are not available in certain developing countries. Further
 many developing countries
 and some developed countries
 do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in TRIPs.

Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
We consider intellectual property protection for certain products
 processes
 uses
 and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations. In addition to the data protection and patents identified below
 we may hold patents on manufacturing processes
 formulations
 devices
 or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below.
The most relevant U.S. patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our top-selling or recently launched patent-protected marketed products are as follows:
Outside the U.S.
 important patent protection or data protection includes:
Baqsimi has been submitted for regulatory review in Japan
 where it is expected to be protected by data protection upon approval (6 years).
Flortaucipir has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. for use as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent and is protected by a compound patent (2029
 not including possible patent extension).
Selpercatinib has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. for the treatment of cancers in certain patients and is protected by a U.S. compound patent (2037
 not including possible patent extension).
Tanezumab has been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain and is expected to be protected by data protection upon approval (12 years).
Worldwide
 we sell all of our major products under trademarks for names and unique product appearance (e.g.
 the appearance of our Trulicity autoinjector) which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world
 with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used
 and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.

Patent Challenges
In the U.S.
 the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984
 commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act
 authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics) when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA
 the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the New Drug Application (NDA)-approved drug—not safety and efficacy. Establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company.
Absent a patent challenge
 the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator’s patents expire. However
 after the innovator has marketed its product for four years
 a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a “Paragraph IV certification.” If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer
 the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are challenged
 the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers.
Generic manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition
 generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk
” i.e.
 after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge. We are currently in Hatch-Waxman litigation involving Alimta with five generic manufacturers. For more information on Hatch-Waxman litigation involving the company
 see Item 8
 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16
 Contingencies” and Item 3
" ""Legal Proceedings."""
Under the BPCI Act
 the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until data protection expires
 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic. However
 the BPCI Act does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator’s patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic. The patent litigation scheme under the BPCI Act is complex and courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in it. Patent holders still have the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration.
In addition
 there is a procedure in U.S. patent law known as inter partes review (IPR)
 which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition
 the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents.
Outside the U.S.
 the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In recent years
 we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the U.S. For more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our Alimta patents in Europe and Japan

 Contingencies.”
Government Regulation
of Our Operations
Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national
 state
 and local agencies. The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing
 data analysis
 manufacturing development
 and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions. Promotion
 marketing
 manufacturing
 and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major markets. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. In addition
 our operations are subject to complex federal
 state
 local
 and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment
 occupational health and safety
 and privacy. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery
 development
 and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort
 expense
 and capital investment.
11
11
""
""
Of particular importance to our business is the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act
 the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing
 safety
 effectiveness
 manufacturing
 quality control
 distribution
 labeling
 marketing
 advertising
 dissemination of information
 and post-marketing surveillance of those products.
The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. Outside the U.S.
 our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements
 notably by the EMA in Europe and the Ministry of Health
 Labor and Welfare in Japan. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive
 company-wide quality systems in our manufacturing
 product development
 and process development operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cGMP and similar regulations. However
 in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements in the future
 we could be subject to interruptions in production
 fines and penalties
 and delays in new product approvals. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties
 and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals.
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws
 including the federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act and state laws governing kickbacks
 false claims
 unfair trade practices
 and consumer protection. These laws are administered by
 among others
 the Department of Justice (DOJ)
 the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
 the Federal Trade Commission
 the Office of Personnel Management
 and state attorneys general. Over the past several years
 state and federal governments have increased their oversight
 enforcement activities
 and intra-agency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Several claims brought by these agencies against us and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities
 including U.S. publicly traded companies
 from promising
 offering
 or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above
 outside the U.S.
 our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Additionally
 in many countries outside the U.S.
 the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore
 our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.
In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA
 the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years
 several jurisdictions
 including China
 Brazil
 and the United Kingdom (U.K.)
 have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area
 increased their enforcement activities
 and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.
We are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions
 which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act)
 criminal sanctions
 and administrative remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other health care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations
 liquidity
 and financial position.
Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
In the U.S.
" we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time) and rebates to private payers who cover patients in certain types of health care facilities that serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B facilities). No rebates are required at this time in the Medicare Part B (physician and hospital outpatient) program where reimbursement is set on an ""average selling price plus 4.3 percent"" formula. Additionally"
 an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. Since 2019
 the Bipartisan Budget Act has required manufacturers of brand-name drugs
 biologics
 and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the “doughnut hole” (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage)
 up from the previous 50-percent discount.
12
12
""
""
Rebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We give rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class.
In 2019
 the White House signed into law targeted amendments to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program statute
 as well as the Fair and Accurate Medicaid Pricing Act
 which was part of the Continuing Appropriations Act. We do not believe either will have a material impact to our business. Several states have passed importation legislation
 including Colorado
 Florida
 Maine
 and Vermont. Specifically
 the state of Florida is working with the Administration to implement an importation program from Canada as early as 2020. We are currently reviewing the state legislation
 as well as corresponding proposed federal rulemaking and guidance recently published by the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA
 the impact of which is uncertain at this time.
In most international markets
 we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs
 which may include price controls
 international reference pricing (to other countries’ prices)
 discounts and rebates
 therapeutic reference pricing (to other
 often generic
 pharmaceutical choices)
 restrictions on physician prescription levels
 and mandatory generic substitution.
Globally
 public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value
 including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition
 third party organizations
 including professional associations
 academic institutions
 and non-profit entities associated with payers
 are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines
 the impact of which are uncertain at this time.
We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative
 regulatory
 or payer developments. However
 in general we expect that state
 federal
 and international legislative and regulatory developments could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
Research and Development
Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of
2019
""
 we employed approximately 7
810 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities
 including a substantial number of physicians
 scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees
 and highly skilled technical personnel.
Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of oncology
 diabetes
 neurodegeneration
 immunology
 and pain. We believe that we have a strong biotechnology research program
 with more than half of our clinical-stage pipeline currently consisting of biologics. In addition to discovering and developing NMEs
 we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses
 formulations
 and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients.
To supplement our internal efforts
 we collaborate with others
 including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians
 hospitals
 medical schools
 and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our pharmaceutical products. We actively invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including licensing arrangements
 co-development and co-marketing agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 joint ventures
 and acquisitions.

Pharmaceutical development is time-consuming
 expensive
 and risky. On average
 only one out of many thousands of molecules discovered by researchers ultimately becomes an approved medicine. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process
 and even late-stage drug candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The rate of innovation cycles leading to medical improvements over initial inventions is accelerating
 which has increased the risk that we opt not to develop a late-stage asset or that new products fail to achieve commercial success due to technical obsolescence - displacement by follow-on competitor products - before the period of exclusivity has ended. After approval and launch of a product
 we expend considerable resources on post-marketing surveillance and additional clinical studies to collect data and understand the benefits and potential risks of medicines as they are used as therapeutics. Consistent with their purpose
 these studies have the potential to identify information about problems with product safety or efficacy that result in product withdrawal. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:
Phases of New Drug Development
The earliest phase of new drug research and development
 the discovery phase
 can take many years. Scientists identify
 design
 and synthesize promising molecules
 screening tens of thousands of molecules for their effect on biological targets that appear to play an important role in one or more diseases. Targets can be part of the body
 such as a protein
 receptor
 or gene; or foreign
 such as a virus or bacteria. Some targets have been proven to affect disease processes
 but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit. Molecules that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria become candidate molecules and move to the next phase of development. The probability of any one candidate molecule becoming a commercial product is extremely low.
The early development phase involves refining candidate molecules
 understanding how to manufacture them efficiently
 and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy. Safety testing is done first in laboratory tests and animals
 as necessary
 to identify toxicity and other potential safety issues that would preclude use in humans. In general
 the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety and find the potential dosing range. After a safe dose range has been established
 the drug is typically administered to small populations of patients (Phase II) to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease
 or biomarkers of the disease
 and to continue to assess safety. In parallel
 scientists work to identify safe
 effective
 and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the molecules that enter the early development phase
 approximately 10 percent move on to the product phase. The early development phase can take several years to complete.
Product phase (Phase III) molecules have met initial safety requirements and
 typically
 shown initial evidence of efficacy. As a result
 these molecules generally have a higher likelihood of success. The molecules are tested in much larger patient populations to demonstrate efficacy to a predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile. These trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agencies for marketing approval. The potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapies
 placebo
 or both. The resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agencies around the world. Phase III testing varies by disease state
 but can often last from three to four years.
Once a molecule is submitted to regulatory agencies
 the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years
 depending on variables such as the disease state
 the strength and complexity of the data presented
 the novelty of the target or compound
 and the time required for the agency(ies) to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval
 or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
14
14
""
""
We believe our investments in research
 both internally and in collaboration with others
 have been rewarded by the large number of new molecules and new indications for existing molecules that we have in all stages of development. We currently have approximately
45
drug candidates across all stages of human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development. Among our new investigational molecules currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapies for various cancers; Alzheimer’s disease; pain; migraine; cluster headache; diabetes; obesity; and autoimmune diseases
 including alopecia areata
 systemic lupus erythematosus
 psoriasis
 atopic dermatitis
 Crohn's disease
 and ulcerative colitis. We are studying many other drug candidates in the earlier stages of development in our chosen priority areas. We are also developing new uses
 formulations
 or delivery methods for many of these molecules as well as several currently marketed products. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline"
""" for more information on certain of our product candidates."
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However
 we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented
 in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product. However
 in the event of an extended failure of a supplier
 it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or
 in some cases
 implemented alternative processes.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S.
 Ireland
 and Puerto Rico. Finishing operations
 including formulation
 filling
 assembling
 delivery device manufacturing
 and packaging
 take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations.
We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities
 contracted arrangements
 and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain a stable supply of our products
 we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems
 inventory management
 and back-up sites.
However
 pharmaceutical production processes are complex
 highly regulated
 and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures
 process modifications
 and regulatory approvals. Accordingly
 if we were to experience unplanned plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities
 significant failure of a contract supplier
 or significant unanticipated increases in demand
 we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded.
Quality Assurance
Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations
 including research and development
 purchasing
 facilities planning
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and dissemination of information about our medicines.
Quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients
 equipment
 facilities
 manufacturing methods

In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K
 the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. It is possible that our business
 financial condition
 liquidity
 cash flows
 or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation.
There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 limited scope of approved uses
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products.
We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether
 if initially granted
 such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop
 license
 or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products
 once launched
 will be commercially successful. We must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 cash flows
 and financial position. See Item 7
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline
” for more details.

Certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic products
 loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors
 leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues
 especially in the U.S. Historically
 outside the U.S. the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the U.S.; however
 generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the U.S.
 including Japan
 Europe
 and many countries in the emerging markets. For biologics (such as Humalog
 Humulin
 Erbitux
 Cyramza
 Trulicity
 Taltz
 and Emgality)
 loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e.
 biosimilars) due to many factors including development timelines
 manufacturing challenges
 and/or uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions.
There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover
 patents relating to particular products
 uses
 formulations
 or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them
 or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters
” and Item 1

Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. Without strong intellectual property protection
 we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market.
Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time
 depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products. In the U.S.
 in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCI Act
 which applies to our biologic products
 the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other pharmaceutical patents. As a result
 we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition
 a separate
""
IPR process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the USPTO without the protections of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Our patents may be invalidated via this review process. Although such a decision can be appealed to the courts
 in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market
 while a win provides no precedential value - the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful
 such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. See Item 1

Public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for
 and patient access to
 our medications. These pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income.
We expect pricing
 reimbursement
 and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the U.S. to become more severe. For more details
 see Item 1
 “Business - Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
” and Item 7
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access.”
We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and generic pharmaceutical companies. To compete successfully
 we must continue to deliver to the market innovative
 cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace
 by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products
 and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world. Particularly for biosimilars
 changes to such regulations could make it easier
 less expensive
 and less time consuming for competitor products to enter the market
 some of which could be substituted for our products at the pharmacy. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs. See Item 1
" “Business - Competition” and ""Business - Research and Development"
""" for more details."
As a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S.
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques
 significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact
 either positive or negative
 on our revenue
 cost of sales
 and operating expenses. In the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency
 the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. See Item 7
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition” for more details.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions
 and in the course of our business
 we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events
 including the separation of Elanco. Changes in the relevant tax laws
 regulations
 administrative practices
 principles
 and interpretations
 as well as events that differ from our expectations
 could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising the U.S. tax law
 effective January 2018
 and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows. See Item 7
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters” and Item 8
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14"
 Income Taxes
""" for more details. Lilly has taken the position on the separation from Elanco"
 based on an opinion of tax counsel
 that the divestiture of Elanco common stock qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any facts
 assumptions
 representations
 and undertakings from Lilly and Elanco regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied
 the divestiture may not qualify for tax-free treatment
 which could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for both Lilly and its shareholders who exchanged their stock for Elanco stock.

A great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our business partners is stored in our information systems
 networks
 and facilities or those of third parties. This includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property
 clinical trial information
 corporate strategic plans
 marketing plans
 customer information
 and personally identifiable information
 such as employee and patient information (collectively
 “confidential information”). We also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems
 infrastructure
 and hardware (together “IT systems”)
 some of which are within the company’s control and some of which are within the control of third parties
 to accumulate
 process
 store
 and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy
 data protection
 and data security. Maintaining the confidentiality
 integrity and availability of our IT systems and confidential information is vital to our business.
IT systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies
 operating failures
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. Cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency
 sophistication
""
""
and intensity
 and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect
 mitigate
 or prevent. Cyber-attacks come in many forms
 including the deployment of harmful malware
 exploitation of vulnerabilities
 denial-of-service attacks
 the use of social engineering
""
""
and other means to compromise the confidentiality

""
confidential information
 and other data. Breaches resulting in the compromise
 disruption
 degradation
 manipulation
 loss
 theft
 destruction
 or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information
 or the unauthorized access to
 disruption of
 or interference with our products and services
 can occur in a variety of ways
 including but not limited to
 negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information
 or wrongful conduct by hackers
 competitors
 certain governments
 or other current or former company personnel. Our third party partners face similar risks
.
The failure or inadequacy of our IT systems
 the compromise
 disruption
 degradation
 manipulation
 loss
 theft
 destruction
 or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information
 or the unauthorized access to
 disruption of
 or interference with our products and services that rely on IT systems
 could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure
 or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on IT systems; damage our operations
 customer relationships
 or reputation; and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. Unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company.
To date
 system inadequacies
 operating failures
 unauthorized access
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 cyber-attacks
 and the compromise
 disruption

 business
 or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our IT systems. We continue to implement measures in an effort to protect
 detect
 respond to
 and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our IT systems; however
 these measures may not be successful. If they are not successful
 any of these events could result in material financial

While pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles
 prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products
 affecting our sales volume. Declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending
 leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. Additionally
 some customers
 including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding
 may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. Also
 if our customers
 suppliers
 or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties
 we could experience slower customer collections
 greater bad debt expense
 and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. Similarly
 in the event of a significant economic downturn
 we could have difficulty accessing credit markets.
Significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe
 including the U.K.; Asia; and other international geographies. Trade disputes and interruptions in international relationships
 including pandemic diseases
 such as the coronavirus
 could result in changes to regulations governing our products and our intellectual property
 or otherwise affect our ability to do business. While we do not expect either circumstance to materially affect our business in a direct manner
 these and similar events could adversely affect us
 or our business partners or customers.
Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. After approval
 the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients; we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. In addition
 we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. Safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims.
We are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving Actos
®
""
 Axiron
®
""
 Byetta
®
""
 Cialis
 and Cymbalta among other products
 as well as litigation and investigations related to the pricing of our products. See Item 8
 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16
 Contingencies
” and Item 3
 “Legal Proceedings
” for more information on our current product liability litigation
 as well as pricing litigation
 investigations
 and inquiries. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products
 we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products
 or to further litigation or investigations into pricing or other commercial practices. Such matters require substantial expenditures to resolve and
 if involving marketed products
 could adversely affect sales of the product. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance
 we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products
 as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters.

The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to extensive regulation. Many companies
 including us
 have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal
 state
 and foreign governmental authorities
 private payers
 and consumers. These claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. We are and could in the future become subject to such investigations
 the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines
 penalties
 or other monetary or non-monetary remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other health care programs. In addition
 regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for our products can lead to product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. See Item 1
 “Business - Government Regulation of Our Operations
” for more details.
Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. Manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities
 or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 could result in product shortages
 leading to lost revenue. Such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters or pandemic disease; mechanical or information technology system vulnerabilities
 such as system inadequacies
 operating failures
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. In addition
 given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity
 it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products. See Item 1
 “Business - Raw Materials and Product Supply
” for more details.
We rely on third parties
 including suppliers
 distributors
 alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
 and third-party service providers
 for selected aspects of product development
 manufacture
 commercialization
 support for information technology systems
 product distribution
 and certain financial transactional processes. For example
 we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of our confidential and proprietary information; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities
 breaches
 or cyber-attacks; or may fail to perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual
 regulatory
 confidentiality
 privacy
 security
 or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Revenue increased in
2019
driven by increased volume
 partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating expenses increased in
2019
""
 reflecting higher late-stage development expenses and increased marketing expenses for recently launched products
 partially offset by lower marketing expenses for late life-cycle products. The increases in net income and EPS in
2019
were driven primarily by the gain recognized on the disposition of Elanco and
 to a lesser extent
 lower acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges. In addition to the increase in net income
 EPS in 2019 significantly benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of the Elanco exchange offer and share repurchases.

(1)
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint.
(2)
Priority Review is designed to expedite the review of potential medicines that
 if approved
 would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment
 diagnosis
 or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications.
There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 limited scope of approved uses
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products.
We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules
 and a delay in
 or termination of
 any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process
 we cannot reliably estimate the nature
 timing
 and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects
 nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline
 and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes
 we must make significant cost estimations and allocations
 some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore
 we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project
 by preclinical versus clinical spend
 or by therapeutic category.

Other Matters
Patent Matters
We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenue
 cash flows
 and earnings.
We lost our patent exclusivity for Strattera
®
in the U.S. in May 2017
 and generic versions of Strattera were approved in the same month. Following a settlement related to the compound patent challenge for Effient
®
""
 generic products launched in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2017. The entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue
 which
 in the aggregate
 has had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
Our compound patent protection for Cialis
®
(tadalafil) and Adcirca
®
(tadalafil) expired in major European markets and the U.S. in November 2017; however
 in the U.S.
 we were granted pediatric exclusivity through May 2018. Another later expiring patent (October 2020) was the subject of U.S. patent litigation and pursuant to a settlement agreement related thereto
 generic tadalafil entered the U.S. market in September 2018. We have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of exclusivity
 which has rapidly and severely eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue.
Our formulation patents for Forteo
®
expired in December 2018
 and our use patents expired in August 2019 in major European markets and the U.S. Both the formulation patent and the use patent expired in August 2019 in Japan. We expect further volume decline as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in these markets. In the aggregate
 we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
The Alimta
®
vitamin regimen patents
 which we expect to provide us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries
 and through May 2022 in the U.S.
 have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. In the U.S.
 we and Eagle Pharmaceuticals
 Inc. (Eagle) reached an agreement in December 2019 to settle all pending litigation
 allowing Eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting February 2022 (up to an approximate three-week supply) and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. Our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller European jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta expired in the U.S. in January 2017
 and expired in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We are aware that several companies have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major European markets (including Germany
 France
 and the Netherlands) and that additional generic competitors may choose to launch at risk. Although we will continue to seek to remove any such products
 generic product entry is resulting in some loss in revenue in these jurisdictions. We expect that further entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product
 which will
 in the aggregate
 have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the U.S.
 Europe
 and Japan regarding our Alimta patents.
The compound patent for Humalog
®
(insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain European markets in 2017 and in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market
 we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however
 we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
As a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S.
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques
 significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact
 either positive or negative
 on our revenue
 cost of sales
 and operating expense. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates
 fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
U.S.
In the U.S.
 public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes
 fees
 rebates
 or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets. Key health policy initiatives affecting biopharmaceuticals include:
California and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business. The Bipartisan Budget Act
 enacted in February 2018
 requires manufacturers of brand-name drugs
 biologics
 and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap
 up from the previous 50 percent discount. This increase in coverage gap discounts became effective at the beginning of 2019. In 2019
 the White House signed into law targeted amendments to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program statute
 as well as the Fair and Accurate Medicaid Pricing Act
 which was part of the Continuing Appropriations Act. We do not believe these will have a material impact to our business. Several states passed importation legislation
 including Colorado
 Florida
 Maine
 and Vermont. Specifically
 the state of Florida is working with the Administration to implement an importation program from Canada as early as 2020. We are currently reviewing the state legislation
 as well as corresponding proposed federal rulemaking and guidance recently published by the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA
 the impact of which is uncertain at this time.
In the private sector
 consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans
 pharmacy benefit managers
 wholesalers
 and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer
 larger entities
 increasingly through vertical integration
 thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions
 such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions
 or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost
 such as non-preferred co-pay tiers
 increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. Consequently
 pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy
 fewer side effects
 or greater patient ease of use
 but also by providing rebates. Value-based agreements are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions
 particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could continue to negatively affect future consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement
 changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays (including co-pay accumulator and maximizer programs). We continue to invest in patient affordability solutions (resulting in lower revenue) in an effort to assist patients in affording their medicines.

The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are currently in effect through both state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. A trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients
 particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions
 many employers in the commercial market continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. Federal legislation
 litigation
 or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the ACA could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. At the same time
 the broader paradigm shift towards performance-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.
International
International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries
 including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach
 given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. As additional reforms are finalized
 we will assess their impact on future revenues. In addition
 governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens
 policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products.
Tax Matters
We are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore
 changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. Countries around the world
 including the U.S.
 actively consider and enact tax law changes. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax policy in countries in which we operate. Modifications to U.S. and foreign tax laws or regulations are frequently enacted and could result in material impacts to our results of operations and financial position.
Acquisitions
We strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe to complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including licensing arrangements
 collaborations
 and acquisitions. We view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies
 as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value. We continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business.
In February 2019
 we acquired all shares of Loxo for a purchase price of
$6.92 billion
""
 net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement
 we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines
 including selpercatinib (LOXO-292)
 an oral RET inhibitor that has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA
 and LOXO-305
 an oral BTK inhibitor.
On January 10
 2020
 we announced an agreement to acquire Dermira
 Inc. for a purchase price of
$18.75
per share
 or approximately
$1.1 billion
.The acquisition will expand our immunology pipeline with the addition of lebrikizumab
 a novel
 investigational
 monoclonal antibody designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity that is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical development program for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. The FDA's fast track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs.The acquisition will also expand our portfolio of marketed dermatology medicines with the addition of Qbrexza
®
(glycopyrronium) cloth
 a medicated cloth approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating). The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020
 subject to customary closing conditions
 including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Dermira's common stock.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.

 primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Included in the revenue of Humalog in the U.S. is our own insulin lispro authorized generic
 which was launched in the second quarter of 2019 in order to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. A competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain European markets in 2017 and in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market
 we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid severe decline in revenue. However
 due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the U.S. and some international markets
 we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time.

Other—net
 (income) expense was income of
$291.6 million
in

compared to income of
$145.6 million
in
2018
primarily driven by higher net gains on investment securities and the gain on the sale of the company's antibiotics business in China

Our effective tax rate was
11.9 percent
in

NM - not meaningful
Revenue increased in 2018 driven by increased volume and
 to a lesser extent
 the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates
 partially offset by lower realized prices. The increases in net income and EPS in 2018 were driven by lower income taxes
 higher gross margin
 and lower asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges
 partially offset by higher acquired IPR&D charges.

In the U.S.
 the revenue increase in
2018
was driven by increased volume for newer products
 including Trulicity
 Basaglar
 Taltz
 Verzenio
 and Jardiance. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume for products that have lost exclusivity
 including Cialis
 Effient
 and Strattera
 as well as lower realized prices for several products
 including Trulicity
 Basaglar
 Forteo
 and Taltz.
Outside the U.S.
 the revenue increase in
2018
was due to increased volume for several newer products
 primarily driven by Trulicity
 Olumiant
 and Taltz and
 to a lesser extent
 the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower realized prices for several products.

Gross Margin
 Costs
 and Expenses
Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 78.2 percent in 2018
 an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared with 2017
 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower amortization expenses
 offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold
 the timing of manufacturing production
 and the negative impact of price on revenue.
Research and development expenses decreased 1 percent to $5.05 billion in 2018 driven by lower development expenses for lanabecestat
 partially offset by higher expenses for other late-stage assets.
Marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses remained flat in 2018 compared to 2017.
Both research and development expenses and marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses benefited during 2018 from actions taken to reduce our cost structure.
We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.98 billion in 2018 primarily related to the acquisition of ARMO and the collaboration with Dicerna. In 2017
 we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid.
We recognized asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges of $266.9 million in 2018. The charges are primarily associated with asset impairments related to the sale of the Posilac
""
(rbST) brand and the related sale of the Augusta
 Georgia manufacturing site and with expenses associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure. In 2017

During 2018
 we recorded income tax expense of $529.5 million while earning $3.68 billion of income before income taxes. We recognized $313.3 million of income tax benefit primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the Toll Tax and GILTI. During 2017
 we recorded income tax expense of $2.40 billion
 which included a provisional tax charge of $1.91 billion
 despite earning $2.30 billion of income before income taxes. The provisional tax charge was a result of the 2017 Tax Act

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash and cash equivalents decreased to
$2.34 billion
as of
December 31
 2019
""
 compared with
$7.32 billion
at
December 31
 2018
. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$4.84 billion
in
2019
""
 compared with
$5.52 billion
in
2018
. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included approximately $360 million of cash paid to settle the accelerated vesting of Loxo employee equity awards (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 included approximately $500 million of net cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations (See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended
December 31
 2019

2018
.
In addition to our cash and cash equivalents
 we held total investments of
$2.06 billion
and
$2.09 billion
as of
December 31
 2019
and
2018
""
 respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
In February 2019
 we completed our acquisition of Loxo for
$235
per share or approximately
$6.9 billion
""
 which was funded through a mixture of cash and debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
As of
December 31
 2019
""
 total debt was
$15.32 billion
""
 an increase of
$5.02 billion
compared with
$10.30 billion
at
December 31
 2018
. The increase primarily related to the net proceeds of $4.45 billion from the issuance of senior notes in February 2019. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper that was issued in connection with the acquisition of Loxo and for general corporate purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
As of
December 31
 2019
""
 we had a total of
$5.21 billion
of unused committed bank credit facilities
""
$5.00 billion
of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any short-term borrowing needs.
For the 134
th
consecutive year
 we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.58 per share and $2.25 per share were paid in
2019
and
2018
""
 respectively. In the fourth quarter of
2019
""
 effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of
2020
""
 the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.74 per share
 resulting in an indicated annual rate for
2020
of $2.96 per share.
Capital expenditures of
$1.03 billion
during
2019
""
 compared to
$1.21 billion
in
2018

In
2019
""
 we repurchased
$4.40 billion
of shares under our
$8.00 billion
share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. As of
December 31
 2019
""
 we had
$1.50 billion
remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
On March 11
 2019
 we completed the disposition of our remaining 80.2 percent ownership of Elanco common stock through a tax-free exchange offer
 which resulted in a reduction in shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 65 million as of that date.
In January 2020
 we announced an agreement to acquire Dermira
 Inc. for
$18.75
per share
 or approximately
$1.1 billion
. The acquisition will be funded through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
"See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection."
We believe cash provided by operating activities
 along with available cash and cash equivalents
 should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs
 including installment payments of the Toll Tax
 dividends paid to shareholders
 share repurchases
 and capital expenditures.
Both domestically and abroad
 we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers
 including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels.
In the normal course of business
 our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing
 investing
 and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.
44
44
""
""
Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures
 we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at
December 31
 2019
and 2018
 including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments
 a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of
December 31
 2019
and 2018
 respectively
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.
Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro and the Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset
 in part
 the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of
December 31
 2019
and 2018
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures
 or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g.
 approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement
 we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments
 they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.
Individually
 these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However
 if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period
 the aggregate charge to expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows
 respectively
 in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product
 which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however
 we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that
 from a business perspective
 we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.

Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at
December 31
 2019
""
 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.
(2)
We have included the following:
(3)
The 2017 Tax Act provided an election to taxpayers subject to the Toll Tax to make payments over an eight-year period. We made this election; therefore
 we have included future Toll Tax payments accordingly.
(4)
We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other post-employment benefit liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $1.20 billion
 because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.
The contractual obligations table is as of
December 31
 2019
. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed
 terminated
 or modified.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP)
 we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses
 and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex
 and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make
 it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that
 given current facts and circumstances
 it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations
 financial position
 or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Return
 Rebate
 and Discount Accruals
We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts
 product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers
 provisions for returns
 rebate and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer
 we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 and chargeback contracts in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount
 we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g.
 patent expiries and product launches)
 an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs
 the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs
 and our product pricing.

""
""
Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return
 rebate
 and discount accruals.
Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration
 as well as royalties
 upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.
Financial Statement Impact
We believe that our accruals for sales returns
 rebates
 and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of
December 31
 2019
""
 a 5 percent change in our global sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability would have led to an approximate
$270 million
effect on our income before income taxes.
The portion of our global sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of
December 31
 2019
and
2018
.
The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability balances
 including managed care

Adjustments of the estimates for these returns
 rebates
 and discounts to actual results were approximately
1 percent
of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.
Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies
Background and Uncertainties
Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are
 by their nature
 uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation
 the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters
 the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation
 and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions
 if any. In addition
 we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred
 but not filed
 to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.
We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage
 we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions
 the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company
 the financial condition of the insurers
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance
 we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage
 we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights
 these considerations include the nature of the indemnification
 the financial condition of the indemnifying party
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection.
The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets
 respectively
 on our consolidated balance sheets.
Acquisitions
Background and Uncertainties
To determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition
 we make certain judgments
 which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules.
47
47
""
""
If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets
 where applicable
 is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business
 the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and
 therefore
 any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date
 and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
 as well as estimated asset lives
 can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets
 including acquired IPR&D
 are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include
 but are not limited to
 probability of technical success
 revenue growth and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances
 we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.
"The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets
Background and Uncertainties
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified
 a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value
 and the cost basis is adjusted.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually
 or more frequently if impairment indicators are present
 by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount
 a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.
Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D
 all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method
” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
For acquired IPR&D assets
 the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product
" as discussed previously in “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such"
 it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.
Estimates of future cash flows
 based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections
 require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
Retirement Benefits Assumptions
Background and Uncertainties
Defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate
 expected return on plan assets
 and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below
 see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.
48
48
""
""
Annually
 we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined
 plan-specific yield curve of high quality
 fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets
 we consider many factors
 with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions
 asset returns and asset allocations (approximately
70 percent
of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results
 as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies
 where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption
 we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.
Annually
 we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 40 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively
 alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty
 adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values
 discounted cash flows valuations
 comparable market valuations
 and adjustments for currency
 credit
 liquidity and other risks.
Financial Statement Impact
If the
2019
discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by
$29.6 million
. If the
2019
expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by
$26.5 million
. If our assumption regarding the
2019
expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year
 our income before income taxes would be affected by
$45.9 million
. The U.S. plans
 including Puerto Rico
 represent approximately
75 percent
and
80 percent
of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets
 respectively
 at
December 31
 2019
.
Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred
 along with other actuarial gains and losses
 and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.
Income Taxes
Background and Uncertainties
We prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these interpretations. In the normal course of business
 our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities
 which may result in future tax
 interest
 and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example
 adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law
 the issuance of regulations by the taxing authorities
 new information obtained during a tax examination
 or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets
 primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets
 we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.

FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR
2020
""
For the full year of
2020
""
 we expect EPS to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.28
 which includes the anticipated impact of the Dermira acquisition. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $23.7 billion and $24.2 billion. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from Trulicity
 Taltz
 Basaglar
 Jardiance
 Verzenio
 Cyramza
 Olumiant
 Emgality
 Baqsimi
 and the launch of Reyvow. Revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for products that have lost patent exclusivity
 including the expected entry of generic competition for Forteo in the U.S. Revenue growth is also expected to be partially offset by a low-single digit net price decline in the U.S. driven primarily by rebates and legislated increases to Medicare Part D cost sharing
 patient affordability programs
 and net price declines in China
 Japan and Europe.
We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 79 percent in
2020
. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion. Marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. Other—net
 (income) expense is expected to be expense in the range of $100 million to $250 million.
The
2020
effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 15 percent.
