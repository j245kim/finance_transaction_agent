Marketing and Distribution
We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations.
U.S.
We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways
 including promoting in online channels
 distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians
 and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition
 we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S.
 and we maintain websites and other media channels with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need.
We maintain special business groups to service wholesalers
 pharmacy benefit managers
 managed care organizations
 group purchasing organizations
 government and long-term care institutions
 hospitals
 and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products.
In the U.S.
 most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies
 physicians and other healthcare professionals
 and hospitals. In 2022
 2021
 and 2020
 three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation
 AmerisourceBergen Corporation
 and Cardinal Health
 Inc.—each accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years. For additional information
 see Item 8
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Revenue."""
Outside the U.S.
The products we market and distribution of our products vary from country to country. Outside the U.S.
 we promote our products to healthcare providers through sales representatives and other channels. In most countries in which we operate
 we maintain our own sales organizations
 but in some countries we market our products through third parties
 some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.
Marketing Collaborations
Certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example
 we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products
 including Trajenta

Competition
Our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.
Important competitive factors include effectiveness
 safety
 and ease of use; formulary placement
 price
 payer coverage and reimbursement rates
 and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products
 processes
 modalities
 and uses. Most new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded
 biosimilar
 or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products
 uses
 or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages
 including by developing new modalities
 our products become subject to decreased sales volumes
 progressive price reductions
 or both.
We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative
 cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers
 and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products
 and it is possible that our products will be
 or will become
 uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or uses developed by our competitors.

Generic Pharmaceuticals
One of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S.
 Europe
 Japan
 and other jurisdictions
 the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy
 allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result
 generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly
 when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity
 it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product
 which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the product's revenue in a very short period of time. Moreover
 governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume-based procurement bidding and other measures.
Further
 public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow
 and in many cases require
 pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory
 it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries outside the U.S.
 intellectual property protection is weak
 and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.
Biosimilars
A number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S.
 the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 the Public Health Service Act
 and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly's biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics
 also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that
 due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic
 may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors
" including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety"
 purity
 and potency.
Globally
 most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics
 including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA
 as well as in Europe and Japan. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. In addition
 the extent to which a biosimilar
 once approved
 will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear
 and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S.
" currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" by the FDA will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the original biologic product. The FDA requirements for interchangeability are evolving but the FDA has issued several ""interchangeable"" designations for biosimilar products"
 including for competitive insulin products
 and is expected to continue doing so in the future.
Regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and
 therefore
 the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have developed biosimilars that compete with our products
 we have developed
 and may continue to develop
 our own biosimilars.
U.S. Private Sector Dynamics
In the U.S. private sector
 consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans
 managed care organizations
 pharmacy benefit managers
 wholesalers
 and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer
 larger entities
 thus enhancing their market power and importance. Private third-party insurers
 as well as governments
 typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement.
8
8
8
""
""
Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions
 such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions
 or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost
 such as non-preferred co-pay tiers
 increased co-insurance levels
 and higher deductibles. Consequently
 pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations
 and compete fiercely for formulary placement
 not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy
 safety profile
 or patient ease of use
 but also by providing rebates or other concessions. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates
 value-based agreements
 where rebates may be based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes
 are another tool that has become increasingly prevalent. Cost is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions
 particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These pressures have negatively affected
 and could continue to negatively affect
 our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement
 changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products

Patents
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Overview
Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines and uses. We own
 have applied for
 or are licensed under
 a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products
 product uses
 formulations
 and manufacturing processes. In addition
 as discussed below
 for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.
The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent) for our products
 particularly those in major markets such as the U.S.
 major European countries
 and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications
 usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process
" which is described in the ""Research and Development"" section below. In general"
 national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application
 which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:
•
Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
•
Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To compensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process
 a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is determined by a formula that cannot be calculated until product approval due to the uncertainty of the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration
 and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency. For example
 Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Also
 in Japan
 South Korea
 Australia
 and other jurisdictions
 patent terms can be extended up to five years
 depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors.

""
Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals
 especially for non-biologic products
 typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product
 often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However
 in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic
 biosimilar
 or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets
 later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes
 methods of use or formulations
 or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:
•
Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example
 the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below)
 effectively 10 years in Europe
 and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.
•
Under the BPCIA
 the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law
 the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic
 subject to certain conditions.
•
In the U.S.
 the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted
" this ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity"
 which is added to the term of data protection and
 for products other than biologics
 to the term of any relevant patents
 to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity begins upon the expiration of the relevant patent
 pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity—i.e.
 a bar to generic or biosimilar approval
 not a patent right.
•
Under the U.S. orphan drug law
" a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200"
000 people in the U.S.
 or affecting more than 200
000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits
 orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity
 meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity
 the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.
Outside the major markets
 the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely
 and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) Agreement administered by the World Trade Organization
" more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of ""flexibilities"" allowed under the TRIPs Agreement. Thus"
 some types of patents
 such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules
 are not available in certain developing countries. Further
 many developing countries
 and some developed countries
 do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement.
Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
We consider intellectual property protection for certain products
 processes
 uses
 and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below
 we may hold patents on manufacturing processes
 formulations

Worldwide
 we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names
 logos
 and unique product appearances (e.g.
 the appearance of our Trulicity autoinjector) that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world
 with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used
 and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.
Patent Licenses and Collaborations
Most of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and collaboration agreements

Patent Challenges
In the U.S.
 the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984
 commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act
 authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics
 which are discussed below in more detail) when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA
" the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only ""pharmaceutical equivalence"" and ""bioequivalence"" between the generic version and the New Drug Application (NDA)-approved-drug"
 not safety and efficacy. Establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company.
Absent a patent challenge
 the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However
 after the innovator has marketed its product for four years
" a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator's NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a ""Paragraph IV certification."" If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer"
 the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company's application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are challenged
 the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers.
Generic manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition
" generic companies have shown willingness to launch ""at risk"
""" i.e."
 after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.
Under the BPCIA
 the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires
 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic
 and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However
 the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.
The patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA
 and the BPCIA itself
 is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA
 as well as by courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. Further
 in the U.S.
" the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. See also ""—Competition—Biosimilars."" In addition"
 there is a procedure in U.S. patent law
 known as inter partes review (IPR)
 which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition
 the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators. We have also observed
 and may continue to observe

Government Regulation of Our Operations
Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national
 state
 and local agencies.
Regulation of Products
The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing
 data analysis
 manufacturing development
 and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation. In addition
 our operations are subject to complex federal
 state
 local
 and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers
 the environment
 occupational health and safety
 data privacy
 and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations
 including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery
 development
 and introduction of new products and uses will continue to require substantial effort
 expense
 and capital investment.
Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act
 the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing
 safety
 effectiveness
 manufacturing
 quality control
 distribution
 labeling
 marketing
 promotion
 advertising
 dissemination of information
 and post-marketing surveillance of those products and devices.
Following approval
 our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling
 import
 export
 storage
 recordkeeping
 advertising
 promotion
 and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market. The FDA also strictly regulates marketing
 labeling
 advertising
 and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
Outside the U.S.
 our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements
 notably by the EMA in Europe
 the Ministry of Health
 Labor and Welfare in Japan
 and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Regulatory and compliance requirements
 as well as approval processes outside the U.S.
 may differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks.
The FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under their cGMP regulations. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive
 company-wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing
 product development
 and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cGMP and other regulations. However
 in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements
 we become subject to potential government investigations
 regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 and reputational harm
 any of which would adversely affect our business. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties
 and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us
 including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products or indications. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and reputation.
We are also subject to a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign environmental
 health and safety
 and other laws and regulations that may affect our research
 development or production efforts.

Emergency Use Authorizations
The Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue an EUA to authorize unapproved medical products
 or unapproved uses of approved medical products
 to be manufactured
 marketed
 and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates
 and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances
 the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict.
Outside the U.S.
 the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that vary and differ from those in the U.S.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination
 the FDA granted EUAs for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together
 certain COVID-19-related uses of baricitinib
 and bebtelovimab
 and similar actions have been taken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. However
 the FDA has revised
 and may in the future further revise
 these EUAs in response to the changing conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic
 such as the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy. In May and November 2022
 respectively
 the FDA announced that bamlanivimab and etesevimab are
 and bebtelovimab is
 not currently authorized for emergency use for any U.S. region.
Other Laws and Regulations
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws
 as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations
 including the federal anti-kickback statute
 the False Claims Act
 and state laws governing kickbacks
 false claims
 unfair trade practices
 and consumer protection. These laws are administered by
 among others
 the Department of Justice
 the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
 the Federal Trade Commission
 the Office of Personnel Management
 and state attorneys general. State
 federal
 and foreign governments
 agencies
 and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight
 enforcement activities
 and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies
 which has resulted in intensified scrutiny
 litigation costs
 corporate criminal sanctions
 and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities
 including U.S. publicly traded companies
 from promising
 offering
 or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above
 our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with officials outside the U.S. Additionally
 in many countries outside the U.S.
 healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore
 our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.
In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA
 the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years
 several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area
 increased their enforcement activities
 and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.
We are
 and could in the future become
 subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions
 which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act)
 criminal sanctions
 and administrative remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations
 liquidity
 and financial position in any given period.
We are also subject to a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign environmental
 health and safety
 and other laws and regulations that may affect our research
 development
 or production efforts.

Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
U.S.
There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition
 U.S. government actions to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs
 including Medicare and Medicaid
 may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products.
In August 2022
 the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures
 the IRA will require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally
 these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under an NDA) or thirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price
 but not a minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be selected
 which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. The establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly impact us.
Other IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a rate greater than the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties
 including civil monetary penalties
 which could be significant.
The IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023
 with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular
 the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under an NDA may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor’s product being selected for price setting are also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation
 and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.
Heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products has also resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to
 among other things
 bring more transparency to product pricing
 review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs
 and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 courts
 or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results. For example
 in April 2022
 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease national coverage determination (the Alzheimer's Monoclonal Antibody NCD) limiting coverage of FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease for people with Medicare only if they are enrolled in qualifying clinical trials. In its current form
 the Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody NCD would result in significantly reduced coverage for
 and negatively impact
 our product candidate donanemab
 and may negatively impact our business and financial results. Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress
 the current U.S. presidential administration
 and regulatory authorities worldwide
 could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.

In the U.S.
 we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs
 including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B covered entities). Additionally
 an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. Since 2019
 the Bipartisan Budget Act has required manufacturers of brand-name drugs
 biologics
" and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the ""doughnut hole"" (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). Beginning in October 2024"
 under the IRA the 70 percent discount will be replaced by a 10 percent discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2
000 threshold and a 20 percent discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2
000 threshold.
Rebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the anti-kickback statute's discount safe harbor
 which have currently been stayed until at least January 1
 2032.
For a discussion of risks related to how we price our products
 see Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face litigation and investigations related to our products"
 how we price our products
 and how we commercialize our products; we could face large numbers of claims in the future
 which could adversely affect our business
" and we are self-insured for such matters."""
Outside the U.S.
Globally
 public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value
 including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition
 third-party organizations
 including professional associations
 academic institutions
 and non-profit entities associated with payers
 conduct and publish comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines
 the impact of which are uncertain.
In most international markets
 we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs
 which may include price controls
 international reference pricing (to other countries' prices)
 discounts and rebates
 therapeutic reference pricing (to other
 often generic
 pharmaceutical choices)
 restrictions on physician prescription levels
 and mandatory generic substitution. In October 2022
 the German Parliament passed cost cutting reforms and these reforms were followed by activation of a clawback mechanism in France and implementation of increased mandatory rebates in the United Kingdom. These changes may be followed in 2023 by biopharmaceutical-focused austerity measures in more countries in Europe and in other markets. Reforms
 including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty
 or as a result of high inflation
 emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war)
 or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic)
 may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative
 regulatory
 or payer developments. However
 in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing
 resulting in additional state
 federal
 and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products.

Research and Development
Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2022
 we employed approximately 9
000 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities
 including a substantial number of physicians
 scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees
 and highly skilled technical personnel.
Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of obesity & diabetes
 immunology
 neuroscience
 and oncology. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic
 we also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines
 we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses
 formulations
 and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients.
To supplement our internal efforts
 we collaborate with others
 including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians
 hospitals
 medical schools
 and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including
 among others
 licensing arrangements
 co-development agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 joint ventures
 acquisitions
 and equity investments.
Pharmaceutical development is time-consuming
 expensive
 and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process
 and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:
Phases of New Drug Development
•
Discovery Phase
In the discovery phase
 scientists identify
 design
 and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development
 which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.
•
Early Development Phase
Early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals
 as necessary. In general
 the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently
 larger populations of patients are studied (Phase II) to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel
 scientists work to identify safe
 effective
 and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase
 approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete.
•
Late Development Phase
Late phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result
 these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies
 placebo
 or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take two to four years.

•
Submission Phase
Once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies
 the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years
 depending on the disease state
 the strength and complexity of available data
 the degree of unmet need
 and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission
 which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval
 or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
We believe our investments in research
 both internally and in collaboration with others
 have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development. We have a number of
new medicine
candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review
 and we have a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline"
""" for more information on our late-stage product candidates."
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However
 we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented
 in the event one of these suppliers becomes unable to provide the materials or product. However
 various developments have led
 and may in the future lead
 to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources
 implement alternative processes
 bring new manufacturing facilities online
 or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S.
 including Puerto Rico
 and Ireland. Finishing operations
 including formulation
 filling
 assembling
 delivery device manufacturing
 and packaging
 take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations.
We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities
 contracted arrangements
 and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet substantially all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products
 we use a variety of techniques
 including comprehensive quality systems
 inventory management
 and back-up sites.
However
 pharmaceutical production processes are complex
 highly regulated
 and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures
 process modifications
 and regulatory approvals. Accordingly
 developments such as unplanned plant shutdowns
 manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities
 failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 increases in demand on a supplier
 or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors have led
 and may in the future lead
 to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products
 product shortages
 or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets. Further
 global transportation and logistics challenges
 cost inflation
 and tight labor markets
 have caused
 and in the future may cause
 delays in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our medicines
 the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity
 procurement activity
 and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. For more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties
 disruptions
 and shortages in the manufacturing
 distribution
 and sale of our products

 or supply chain difficulties
 disruptions
" or shortages could lead to product supply problems."""
In addition
 cost inflation
 the strain on global transportation
 logistics
 and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 war or unrest
 including the Russia-Ukraine war)
 global economic downturns or uncertainty
 and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had
 and may continue to have
 a number of impacts on our business
 including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines. For more information
 see Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Public health outbreaks"

 or pandemics
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic

Quality Assurance
Our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality requires a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations
 including research and development
 purchasing
 facilities planning
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and dissemination of information about our medicines.
Quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients
 equipment
 facilities
 manufacturing methods
 packaging materials
 and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses
 microbiological testing
 testing in animals
 or a combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers.
Executive Officers of the Company
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers.
The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors
 to be held on May 1
 2023 in connection with the company's annual meeting of shareholders
" or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer has a ""family relationship"" with any other director or executive officer of the company"
 as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement. There is no understanding between any executive officer or director and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected.

Human Capital Management
Our core values—integrity
 excellence
 and respect for people—shape our approach to attracting
 retaining
 engaging
 and developing a highly skilled and ethical workforce
 which is critical to executing our strategy. We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance
 most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists
 and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success.
We are committed to creating a safe
 supportive
 ethical
 and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital management process
 fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices
 robust training and development opportunities
 and competitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to promoting diversity
 equity
 and inclusion (DEI) within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business success and growth.
We regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders to identify opportunities to adjust our policies and benefits to improve our employees' experience. As a result of our efforts
 we believe that we have a highly performing
 cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.
At the end of 2022
 we employed approximately 39
000 people
 including approximately 21
000 employees outside the U.S. Our employees include approximately 9
000 people engaged in research and development activities.
Strategy and Oversight
In order to build diverse and inclusive teams
 our CEO and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders accountable for achieving results. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance
 our board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract
 retain
 engage
 and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission.
Diversity
 Equity
 and Inclusion
We are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices
 and we deeply value diverse backgrounds
 skills
 and global perspectives. To fulfill our purpose
 we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse experiences of the patients who depend on us.
We believe that fostering DEI begins with understanding. For example
 our
Employee Journeys
research has yielded important insights about the experiences of women
 Black/African American
 Latinx
 Asian
 and LGBTQ+ employees at Lilly. The results of this research are reviewed by our senior leadership
 and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture.
In 2020
 as part of our DEI and community initiatives
 Lilly and the Lilly Foundation launched the Racial Justice Commitment
 with Lilly pledging 25
000 volunteer hours and the Lilly Foundation committing $25 million over five years to help decrease the burden of racial injustice and its effects on communities of color. The Racial Justice Commitment aims to drive change across five areas: internal people development
 health equity
 social impact
 diversity partners
 and family sustaining jobs
 through the use of financial and people resources. From 2020 through 2022
 we have made progress in these efforts
 including nearly tripling our spending with Black-owned businesses
 committing over $98 million in minority-led venture capital firms
 serving over 30
000 volunteer hours to advance racial justice initiatives
 and expanding our Skills First Program at Lilly for individuals without four-year college degrees.
Since 2017
 we have committed to increasing women
 Black/African American
 Latinx
 and Asian representation in leadership roles
 and we actively monitor our progress. From the end of 2018 through the end of 2022
 we increased the percentage of women in management globally from 42 percent to 49 percent. For minority group members (MGM) in the U.S. over the same period
 we increased management representation from 19 percent to 25 percent. Across all levels of our workforce
 from the end of 2018 through the end of 2022
 we have seen increased representation for MGMs in the U.S. and women globally. Our focus on DEI is also evident at our executive committee and board of directors. Five of 15 current members (approximately 33 percent) of our executive committee (which includes our CEO) are women and three are MGMs. In addition
 as of the filing of this report
 the company's 13-member board of directors includes five women and six members who are MGMs.

Employee Development
We believe attracting and retaining the best
 diverse talent begins with the hiring process. We therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions. We believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers.
In early 2022
 we launched
Discover
""
 a 12-month new employee onboarding program with multiple touchpoints designed to foster integration into Lilly
 to accelerate learning in their new roles and to create connections to further a sense of belonging at Lilly.
Discover
was shaped in part by external benchmarking
 feedback from employees
 and learnings from onboarding remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry. We also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences
 helping them build rewarding careers. We have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings in addition to our in-person programs. Many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs. Across Lilly
 we are continuously working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective. In addition
 we have implemented development tools and resources for all employees
 improved our talent programs and processes to provide broader access to information
 and increased transparency regarding career development and advancement at Lilly.
Employee resource groups (ERGs) are another important component of developing talent at Lilly. We currently have 11 ERGs representing groups including women
 MGMs
 LGBTQ+ individuals
 veterans
 and people with disabilities. ERGs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build relationships
 engage with senior leaders
 advance our caring community
 and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business.
We have continued our efforts to create an inclusive workplace with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and share their ideas at work. Our Make it Safe to Thrive education and awareness program is designed to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced and includes live and online training. In late 2022
 we introduced a new version of Make it Safe to Thrive for leaders that continues to focus on psychological safety and creating an inclusive environment. Leaders are provided the opportunity to work through challenging conversations and situations currently being navigated in the workplace.
Lilly is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and respect in the workplace—an environment free of discrimination
 harassment
 or retaliation of any kind. In 2022
 as part of our annual review of The Red Book and related policies and procedures
 we revised the Global Conduct in the Workplace procedure to continue to help ensure that we maintain a respectful
 safe
 inclusive
 and professional workplace.
Employee Health and Safety
We strive to foster a healthy
 vibrant work environment
 which includes keeping our employees safe. We seek to create a companywide culture where best-in-class safety practices are consistently followed. To do this
 we assess and continuously attempt to improve our companywide safety performance to promote the well-being of employees and to help safeguard communities where we operate. As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved
 we have continued to take various measures (as necessary) to protect and support the health and safety of our employees globally. We believe a holistic approach and dedication to safety helps us be our best as we deliver on our company purpose to improve lives around the world.

Risk Factors
In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. It is possible that our business
 financial condition
 liquidity
 cash flows

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation.
Risks Related to Our Business
•
Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing
 licensing
 or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.
There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development
 the introduction of new products
 and business development activities to enhance our product pipeline.
There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 the application of pricing controls
 limited scope of approved uses
 label changes
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays
 uncertainties
 unpredictabilities
 and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches
 lost market opportunity
 potential impairment of inventories
 and other negative impacts. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications.
We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether
 if initially granted
 such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop
 license
 or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products
 once launched
 will be commercially successful.
We must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or line extensions for existing products
 both through our internal efforts and our business development activities
 sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls
 lose intellectual property exclusivity
 or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 cash flows
 and financial position.
We engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline
 including licensing arrangements
 co-development agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 joint ventures
 acquisitions
 and equity investments. There are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry
 including by the Federal Trade Commission and competition authorities in Europe and other jurisdictions
 and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay
 jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition
 failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses
 products
 or assets we acquire (including related technology
 commercial operations
 compliance programs
 information security
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to developments outside our control
 including unsuccessful clinical trials
 issues related to the quality
 integrity
 or broad applicability of data
 regulatory impediments
 and commercialization challenges. Accordingly
 business

development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all)
 may not result in successful development outcomes or successful commercialization of any product

We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues
 cash flows
 and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted
 and in the future is likely to continue to result
 in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.
In the ordinary course of their lifecycles
 our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S.
 as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S.
 after a specified period of time. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We have faced
 and remain exposed to
 generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection. For example
 following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021
 we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels
 and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenue from current levels in these markets. In addition
 as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity for Alimta in in the first half of 2022
 we began facing
 and expect to continue to face
 generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels
 and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels.
Certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic products
 loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors
 leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues
 especially in the U.S. For biologics (such as Humalog
 Humulin
 Erbitux
 Cyramza
 Trulicity
 Taltz
 and Emgality)
 loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e.
 biosimilars) due to many factors
 including development timelines
 manufacturing challenges
 and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. Generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation.
There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover
 patents relating to particular products
 uses
 formulations
 or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them
 or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"
""" and Item 1"
" ""Business—Patents"
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
""" for more details."
•
Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated
 circumvented
 or weakened
 our business will be adversely affected.
Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative medicines. Without strong intellectual property protection
 we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development
 as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market. Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time
 depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws
 regulations
 and enforcement practices could reduce protections for our innovative products and indications. For example
 potential reforms to pharmaceutical legislation in the European Union may threaten the predictability and length of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives. Changes proposed by the USPTO to limit the number of
 and differences between
 patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for our products in the U.S. Also in the U.S.
 in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA
 which applies to biologic products
 the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering pharmaceutical products. As a result
 we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products
 including biologics
 will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation
25
25
25
""
""
and may not be upheld. In addition
 a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. Recently
 the USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding the use of discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation. However
 it is not clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings after institution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited review process
 even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent
 our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court
 meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful
 such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. In addition
 intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face additional risks to our intellectual property rights
 including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch. See Item 1
" ""Business—Patents"
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights

•
We and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers
 and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and generic pharmaceutical companies and
 in many cases
 our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully
 we must continue to deliver to the market innovative
 cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace
 by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products
 and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations
 including new modalities
 that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.
Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars
 health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. In the U.S.
" the FDA has issued several ""interchangeability"" designations for biosimilar products"
 and is expected to continue doing so in the future. These designations could – subject to state law requirements – enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for innovator biological products. Given the importance of biologic products to our clinical-stage pipeline
 such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1
" ""Business—Competition"" and ""Business—Research and Development"
""" for more details."
In addition
 we rely on our ability to attract
 engage
 and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel in order to compete effectively. To continue to commercialize our products
 and advance the research
 development
 and commercialization of additional modalities
 indications
 and product candidates
 we have expanded
 and will likely need to further expand
 our workforce
 including in the areas of manufacturing
 clinical trials management
 regulatory affairs
 and sales and marketing
 both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 academic and other research institutions
 as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities
 which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly competitive environment may be further complicated by evolving employment trends
 including as related to increased preferences for remote or flexible work arrangements; public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic; political
 social
 civil
 or cultural unrest; emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 war and unrest; or the threat of or perceived potential for any of the foregoing events. Our failure to compete effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future

Failure
 inadequacy
 breach of
 or unauthorized access to
 our IT systems or those of our third-party service providers
 unauthorized access to our confidential information
 or violations of data protection laws
 could each result in material harm to our business and reputation.
A great deal of confidential information owned by us or our business partners or other third parties is stored in our information systems
 networks
 and facilities or those of third parties. This includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property
 clinical trial information
 corporate strategic plans
 marketing plans
 customer information
 and personally identifiable information
 such as employee and patient information (collectively
 confidential information). We also rely
 to a large extent
 on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems
 infrastructure
 and hardware (together
 IT systems)
 some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties
 to accumulate
 process
 store
 and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy
 data protection
 and data security. Maintaining the security
 confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of our IT systems and confidential information is vital to our business. Our failure
 or the failure of our third-party service providers
 to protect and maintain the security
 confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of our (or their) IT systems and our confidential information and other data could significantly harm our reputation as well as result in significant costs
 including those related to fines
 litigation
 and obligations to comply with applicable data breach laws.
IT systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies
 operating failures
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources
 which may remain undetected for significant periods of time. Such vulnerabilities
 inadequacies
 or failures are in many cases more acute for IT systems associated with recently acquired businesses
 and we may be unable to address such vulnerabilities
 inadequacies
 or failures immediately after acquiring a business. As a result
 our newly acquired businesses could be more vulnerable to potential interruptions
 breaches
 intrusions
 or attacks.
Cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency
 sophistication
 and intensity
 and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect
 mitigate
 or prevent. Cyber-attacks come in many forms
 including the deployment of harmful malware
 exploitation of vulnerabilities (including those of third-party software or systems)
 denial-of-service attacks
 the use of social engineering
 and other means to compromise the confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of our IT systems
 confidential information
 and other data. Breaches resulting in the compromise
 disruption
 degradation
 manipulation
 loss
 theft
 destruction
 or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information
 or the unauthorized access to
 disruption of
 or interference with our IT systems
 products and services
 can occur in a variety of ways
 including negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information
 or wrongful conduct by hackers
 competitors
 certain governments or nation-states
 or other current or former company personnel. Our third-party partners
 including third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services
 as well as suppliers
 distributors
 alliances
 and other third parties with whom we may share data
 face similar risks
 which could affect us directly or indirectly. Unassociated third parties present further risks
 including by propagating misinformation related to our products
 business
 and industry. The healthcare industry has been and continues to be a target for cyber-attacks
 and the number of threats has increased over time. Numerous federal agencies that monitor and regulate internet and cyber-crime have issued guidance
 alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching
 malicious actors targeting healthcare-related systems and nation-state sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information.

•
Economic downturns or international trade and other global disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products
 affecting our sales. Declining tax revenues and increased government spending on other programs attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending
 leading to increased control of drug prices or lower utilization. Additionally
 some customers
 including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding
 may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner. Also
 if our customers
 suppliers
 or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties
 we could experience slower customer collections
 greater bad debt expense
 and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. Similarly significant economic downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets.
In addition
 significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe (including the United Kingdom)
 Asia (including China)
 and other international geographies. Trade and other global disputes and interruptions in international relationships
 including related to tariffs
 trade protection measures
 import or export licensing requirements
 the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments
 unrest or war
 as well as public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic
 affect our ability to do business. For example
 tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland
 as well as other business restrictions. As a further example
 the financial impact of higher energy prices
 defense spending
 and inflation due
 in part
 to the Russia-Ukraine war and resulting geopolitical and economic disruptions
 particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic
 has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments with single-payer or government funded healthcare systems
 leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates
 clawbacks
 and other reforms to reimbursement systems
 particularly in Europe. These and similar events have adversely affected
 and may continue to adversely affect
 us
 our business partners
 and our customers. For more details

Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns
 which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues
 income
 and reputation.
Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. After approval
 the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients. Accordingly
 we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. In addition
 we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have
 and could in the future
 result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. Safety issues have
 and could in the future
 result in costly product liability claims.

We face litigation and investigations related to our products
 how we price our products
 and how we commercialize our products; we could face large numbers of claims in the future
 which could adversely affect our business
 and we are self-insured for such matters.
We are subject to a substantial number of claims involving various current and historical products
 litigation and investigations. These claims relate to how we commercialize and/or how we price our products
 including relating to our 340B drug pricing program
 as well as contractual matters and other disputes. See Item 8
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies"" for more information on our current product liability litigation"
 as well as pricing and other litigation
 investigations
 and inquiries. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products
 we are
 and could in the future become
 subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our previous
 current
 or future products
 or to further litigation or investigations
 including related to pricing or other commercial practices. Such matters could affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and
 if involving marketed products
 could adversely affect sales of the product and our consolidated results of operations in any given period. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance
 we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all of our currently marketed products
 as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters.
•
Manufacturing
 quality
 or supply chain difficulties
 disruptions
 or shortages could lead to product supply problems.
Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. Manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or those of our contractors and suppliers
 the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 or increases in demand on a supplier could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing
 distribution
 and sale of our products and/or product shortages
 leading to lost revenue. In select cases
 supply constraints may also lead to pauses
 discontinuations or other product availability issues in one or more markets
 which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Further
 cost inflation and global transportation and logistics challenges
 as well as tight labor markets
 have caused
 and in the future may cause
 delays in
 and/or increase costs related to
 distribution of our medicines
 the construction or other acquisition of manufacturing capacity
 procurement activity
 and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. Such difficulties
 disruptions
 or challenges could result from quality
 oversight
 or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters (including increased instances of natural disasters or other events that may be due to climate change)
 public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); periods of global economic downturn or uncertainty; emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war); equipment
 mechanical
 data
 or IT system vulnerabilities
 such as system inadequacies
 inadequate controls or procedures
 operating failures
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; labor shortages; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; or inability to obtain single-source or other raw or intermediate materials. Regional dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and supply. For example
 we
 and the pharmaceutical industry generally
 depend on China-based partners for integral chemical synthesis
 reagents
 starting materials
 and ingredients.
Difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted
 and in the future may result
 in difficulty meeting demand for
 or disruptions
 shortages
 and higher costs in the supply of
 our products. For example
 we have experienced challenges in meeting demand for our incretin products
 partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies. Despite our ongoing efforts to meet significant expected demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity
 there can be no assurances that such capacity increases will be realized as expected. Delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity would limit our ability to capitalize on expected demand. Conversely
 unexpected contingencies that limit demand for our incretin products would undermine our ability to realize the full benefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred
 and expect to continue to incur
 to augment manufacturing capacity and may also subject us to contractual payment obligations. The foregoing risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and reputation. See Item 1

 Trulicity accounted for 26 percent of our total revenues in 2022 and we expect GLP-1s

 managed care organizations
 pharmacy benefit managers
 and other supply chain stakeholders has increased due to consolidation
 regulatory
 and other market impacts
 and they
 along with governments
 increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs
 including through the use of formulary inclusion
 or favorable formulary placement. Such stakeholders have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools favoring the use of generic products. As these practices expand
 including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. private third-party payers
 we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain stakeholders will continue to increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.
We rely on third parties
 including suppliers
 distributors
 alliances
 and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
 and third-party service providers
 for selected aspects of product and clinical development
 manufacturing
 commercialization
 hosting of
 and support for
 IT systems
 product distribution
 and certain financial transactional processes. As examples
 we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. Outsourcing involves many risks
 including the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements
 including applicable requirements for diversity in clinical trials; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us
 our clinical trial subjects
 or patients; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to IT system vulnerabilities
 breaches
 cyber-attacks
 or inadequate controls or procedures; may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in which case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing; or may fail to perform at all. The foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the U.S.
 where we may have fewer alternative providers as well as face additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks. Failure of third parties to meet their contractual
 regulatory
 confidentiality
 privacy
 security
 or other obligations to us
 our clinical trial subjects
 and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business.

COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to varying and fluctuating degrees
 including as a result of:
•
Cost inflation and strain on global transportation
 manufacturing
 and labor markets
 which have negatively impacted development
 manufacturing
 supply
 distribution
 and sales of our medicines
 including through increased costs to provide
 and in some cases disruptions in supply or shortages of
 our medicines.
•
Fewer in-person interactions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain markets.
•
Pricing pressures
 rebates
 clawbacks
 and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting
 in part
 from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.
•
Risks related to our COVID-19 therapies
 including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations; restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies
 and risks related to handling
 return
 and/or refund of product after delivery by us; concerns related to expedited authorization of restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data; and fluctuations in
 or elimination of
 demand for our COVID-19 therapies
 including based on the availability of superior or competitive therapies
 preventative measures such as vaccines and antiviral medicines
 mutations of the virus impacting effectiveness
 revocations or restrictions on EUAs
 reaching endemic status in different jurisdictions
 reduced government and payer funding for COVID-19 therapies
 the unpredictable nature of pandemics
 and other developments.
These and other risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other actual or threatened public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics could affect other aspects of our business or intensify other risks inherent in our business. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect us and other actual or threatened public health outbreaks
 epidemics
 or pandemics could affect us
 will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control
 including the duration and severity of the public health threat
 the actions taken to reduce its transmission
 the introduction and spread of new variants
 the degree and extent of government restrictions on economic activity
 government spending
 and access to healthcare
 and the speed with which
 and extent to which
 economic and operating conditions recover. Should the COVID-19 pandemic
 or any other actual or threatened public health outbreak
 epidemic
 or pandemic
 as well as any associated or resulting cost of inflation
 supply chain disruption
 labor market impact
 recession
 depression
 or other negative contingency
 continue for a prolonged period
 these risks could be exacerbated
 causing further impact on our business and operations.
Risks Related to Government Regulation
•
Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing
 reimbursement
 and access for our drugs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
 reputation or business.
Public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for
 and patient access to
 our medicines. These pressures have negatively affected
 and could continue to negatively affect
 our consolidated results of operations. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of
 and actions intended to address
 pricing
 reimbursement
 and access to pharmaceutical products. Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration and regulatory authorities worldwide
 could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. In particular
 if one or more of our significant products are selected under the IRA
 the resulting price reduction and reimbursement could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For more details

Further
 restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments

Changes in foreign currency rates
 interest rate risks
 or inflation affect our results of operations.
As a global company
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates
 and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions
 each of which impacts our results of operations. In recent periods
 significant fluctuations in currency rates and inflation have had a significant negative impact on our results of operations. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and our results of operations may continue to be adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar remains strong compared to foreign currencies. Further
 in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency in a particular market in which we operate
 the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. Inflationary pressures in recent periods have also negatively impacted us and may continue to negatively impact us in various ways
 including cost inflation
 higher labor costs
 and other higher expenses
 with some of these higher expenses due in part to policy actions intended to curb inflation. See Item 7

We are subject to evolving and complex tax laws
 which may result in additional liabilities and affect our results of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions
 and in the course of our business
 we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events. Changes in tax laws
 regulations
 administrative practices
 principles
 and interpretations
 as well as events that differ from our expectations
 have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates
 cash flows
 and/or results of operations. Significant uncertainty currently exists regarding tax proposals introduced by the current U.S. administration and Congress
 including modifications to certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
 such as the potential repeal or deferral of the provision requiring capitalization of research and development expenses. In addition
 tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions
 which could unfavorably impact our results of operations. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Modifications to key elements of the current U.S. or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. See Item 7

Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.
""
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation. Many companies
 including us
 are and have been subject to investigations and claims related to these practices asserted by federal
 state
 and foreign governmental authorities
 private payers
 and consumers. These investigations and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. We are
 and could in the future become
 subject to such investigations and claims
 the outcomes of which include criminal charges and fines
 penalties
 or other monetary or non-monetary remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. Such investigations and claims have intensified and may continue to intensify as a result of the regulatory priorities of each particular U.S. presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide. In addition
 regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP
 quality assurance
 evolving standards
 and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines
 and
32

""
""
similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 and reputational harm
 any of which would adversely affect our business. Regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may also be less predictable and result in additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks. See Item 1
" ""Business—Government Regulation of Our Operations"
""" for more details."
Furthermore
 there is an increased focus by foreign
 federal
 state
 and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change
 regulating greenhouse gas emissions
 carbon taxes
 emissions trading schemes
 sustainable manufacturing
 human rights and equity matters
 and disclosure regarding the foregoing
 many of which may be ambiguous
 inconsistent
 dynamic or conflicting. We expect to experience increased restrictions and compliance costs
 legal costs
 and expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements. Moreover
 compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements would require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters. In addition
 we may still be subject to penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices.
Additionally
 we are subject to increased negative attention from the media
 stockholders
 activists
 and other stakeholders on climate change
 social
 and sustainability matters. The perception that we have failed to act in a socially responsible manner
 whether or not valid
 results in adverse publicity that can negatively affect our business and reputation
 as well as result in increased scrutiny from legislators and regulatory authorities. Moreover
 from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments
 including to reduce our impact on the environment. Our ability to achieve any stated environmental
 social or governance goal
 target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions
 many of which are outside our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements
 the availability of requisite financing
 and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other goals. If we fail to achieve
 are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving
 or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments
 it could negatively affect our reputation or investor confidence
 and expose us to enforcement actions and litigation.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock Index and our peer group for the years 2018 through 2022. The graph assumes that
 on the last business day of 2017
 a person invested $100 each in Lilly stock
 the S&P 500 Stock Index
 and the peer group's collective common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return
 which takes into account both stock price and dividends. It assumes that dividends paid by a company are immediately reinvested in that company's stock.

Revenue increased in 2022 driven by increased volume
 largely offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Research and development expenses increased in 2022
 driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets
 partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses in 2022 remained relatively flat compared to 2021 as increased costs associated with launches of new products and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2022 and 2021 financial results:
2022
Acquired IPR&D and Development Milestones (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized $908.5 million of acquired IPR&D and development milestones that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review Voucher.
Asset Impairment
 Restructuring
 and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized charges of $244.6 million primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for GBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing.
Other-Net
 (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized $410.7 million of net investment losses on equity securities.
2021
Cost of Sales (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized a net inventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies of $339.7 million. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic
 and at the request of the United States (U.S.) and international governments
 we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk
 in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved during 2021
 we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to demand from U.S. and international governments
 including changes to our agreement with the U.S. government
 and near-term expiry dates of COVID-19 antibodies.
Acquired IPR&D and Development Milestones (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized $970.1 million of acquired IPR&D and development milestones that included charges resulting from business development transactions with Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. (Foghorn)
 Rigel Pharmaceuticals
 Inc. (Rigel)
 and Precision Biosciences
 Inc. (Precision).

There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products
 as well as a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 the application of pricing controls
 limited scope of approved uses
 label changes
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays
 uncertainties
 unpredictabilities
 and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications.
We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in
 or termination of
 any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process
 we cannot reliably estimate the nature
 timing
 and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects
 nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline
 and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes
 we must make significant cost estimations and allocations
 some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore
 we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project
 by preclinical versus clinical spend
 or by therapeutic category.

Other Matters
Patent Matters
We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue
 cash flows
 and earnings.
Following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta
®
in Europe and Japan in June 2021
 we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels
 and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. In addition
 as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022
 we began facing
 and expect to continue to face
 generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels
 and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels. This decline in revenue will continue to impact period-over-period financial results comparisons
 particularly during the first half of 2023. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents.
Our compound patents for Humalog
®
(insulin lispro) have expired in the U.S. and major international markets
 and we have also introduced lower-priced versions of Humalog as part of our insulin access and affordability solutions. A competitor has a similar version of insulin lispro in the U.S. and in certain European markets. Due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the U.S. and certain international markets
 we expect that lower revenue for Humalog due to realized price decline will continue over time.
Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
Reforms
 including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty
 or as a result of high inflation
 emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war)
 or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic)
 may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
Global concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action
 as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts
 price reporting requirements
 mandated reference prices
 restrictive formularies
 changes to available intellectual property protections
 as well as other efforts. In August 2022
 the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures
 the IRA will require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally
 these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price
 but not a minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be selected
 which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. The establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly impact us.
Other IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a rate greater than the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties
 including civil monetary penalties
 which could be significant.
The IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023
 with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular
 the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a new drug application may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting are also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation
 and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.

Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including those proposed and/or pursued by the U.S. Congress
 the current U.S. presidential administration
 and regulatory authorities worldwide
 could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.
Consolidation and integration of private payors and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore
 restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 courts
 or private payers
 such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' national coverage determination for monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
 may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products
 such as insulin
 as governments manage and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic
 which could adversely affect our business. In addition
 we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340B program and access to insulin that
 if resolved adversely to us
 could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.
In addition
 regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices
 quality assurance
 evolving standards
 and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines
 and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 and reputational harm
 any of which would adversely affect our business. Moreover
 increased focus on business combinations across industries and jurisdictions can lead to impediments to the completion of business combinations.

" and Access"" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information."
Product Supply
We have faced challenges
 and expect to continue to face challenges
 meeting strong demand for our incretin products
 including due to the limited and fluctuating availability of competitor therapies. In the U.S.
 given very strong uptake of Mounjaro following its launch in the U.S. for type 2 diabetes in the second quarter of 2022
 and as demand for Trulicity
®
has remained strong
 we have experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain U.S. orders for these products. Outside the U.S.
 we have implemented certain actions to minimize the impact on existing Trulicity patients
 but we expect to continue to experience intermittent disruptions in our supply of Trulicity in international markets.
We anticipate tight supplies of our incretin products will persist until additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. We expect additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity will become fully operational around the world in the next several years
 with significant expansion in 2023
 as part of our ongoing efforts to meet the significant demand for our incretin medicines.
Tax Matters
We are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore
 changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. In 2017
 the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act)
 which contained a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. Previously
 these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. The implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. While the implementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes
 the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period.
43

43
""
""
The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions. Changes to existing U.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Other Impacts
As a global company
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro
 Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques
 significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact
 either positive or negative
 on our consolidated results of operations in any given period. During the year ended December 31
 2022
 revenue was unfavorably impacted by 3 percent due to foreign exchange rates. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates
 fluctuations in these rates have
 and we currently expect in the near-term future will
 adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
In addition
 cost inflation
 the strain on global transportation
 logistics
 and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence or escalation of
 and responses to
 war or unrest
 including the Russia-Ukraine war)
 global economic downturns or uncertainty
 and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had
 and may continue to have
 a number of impacts on our business
 including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines.
Acquisitions
We invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including acquisitions
 collaborations
 investments
 and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.
COVID-19 Pandemic
As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves
 we remain focused on protecting the health
 safety
 and well-being of our employees; supporting the medical system and our communities; and affordability of and access to our medicines. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic
 we also focused on researching
 developing
 and supplying COVID-19 therapies
 although we do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to treatments for COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to varying and fluctuating degrees
 including as a result of cost inflation and strain on the global transportation
 manufacturing
 and labor markets
 fewer in-person interactions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain markets
 pricing pressures
 rebates
 clawbacks
 and other changes in reimbursement policies resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems
 and risks related to our COVID-19 therapies. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control. For additional information

Revenue of Trulicity increased 16 percent in the U.S.
 driven by increased demand
 partially offset by lower realized prices due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 12 percent
 driven by increased volume
 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and
 to a lesser extent
 lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain U.S. Trulicity orders during the second half of 2022. Actions to manage strong demand across our incretin portfolio
 including measures to minimize existing patient impact in international markets
 also affected volume in 2022.
Revenue of Verzenio increased 98 percent in the U.S.
 primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 61 percent
 driven by increased demand

 partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 13 percent
 driven by increased volume
 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices.
Revenue of Jardiance increased 48 percent in the U.S.
 primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 28 percent
 primarily driven by increased demand
 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.

Revenue of Humalog decreased 10 percent in the U.S.
 primarily driven by lower realized prices due to a list price reduction of insulin lispro injection and unfavorable segment mix
 partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in 2021. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 23 percent
 primarily driven by lower realized prices due to the impact of VBP in China and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the U.S. and certain international markets
" we expect that lower revenue for Humalog due to realized price decline will continue over time. See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"" for additional information."
Revenue of COVID-19 antibodies was $2.01 billion in the U.S. during the year ended December 31
 2022
 primarily due to bebtelovimab supplied to the U.S. government. COVID-19 antibodies are not currently authorized for emergency use in the U.S. We do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to the treatment of COVID-19.
Revenue of Alimta decreased 56 percent in the U.S.
 primarily driven by decreased demand due to the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 54 percent
 primarily driven by decreased demand due to generic competition. Following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021
 we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels
 and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. In addition
 as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022
 we began facing
 and expect to continue to face
 generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels

Gross Margin
 Costs
 and Expenses
Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.8 percent in 2022
 an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2021
 primarily driven by a net inventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies recognized in 2021 and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in 2021. Additionally
 in 2022
 favorable product mix
 including the impact of lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19
 were offset by lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs.
Research and development expenses increased 4 percent to $7.19 billion in 2022
 driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets
 partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $6.44 billion in 2022
 as increased costs associated with launches of new products and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
We have undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation
 which will increase compensation costs and impact our consolidated results of operations.
We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $908.5 million in 2022 that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review Voucher. We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $970.1 million in 2021 that included charges resulting from business development transactions with Foghorn
 Rigel
 and Precision. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
We recognized asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges of $244.6 million in 2022
 primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for GBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing. We recognized asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges of $316.1 million in 2021
 primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo
 an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza
 as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail.
Other—net
 (income) expense was expense of $320.9 million in 2022
 primarily driven by net investment losses on equity securities. Other—net
 (income) expense was expense of $201.6 million in 2021
 primarily driven by a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt
 partially offset by net investment gains on equity securities.
Our effective tax rate was 8.3 percent in 2022
 reflecting the favorable tax impact of the implementation of a provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022
 partially offset by the tax impact of the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate was 9.3 percent in 2021
 reflecting the favorable tax impacts of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges
 net investment gains on equity securities
 and a net discrete tax benefit.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
We believe our available cash and cash equivalents
 together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings
 are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements
 which include:
•
working capital requirements
 including related to employee payroll
 clinical trials
 manufacturing materials
 and taxes;
•
capital expenditures;
•
share repurchases and dividends;
•
repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;
•
contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;
•
milestone and royalty payments; and
•
potential business development activities
 including acquisitions
 collaborations
 investments
 and licensing arrangements.
Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources
 including our access to external capital
 to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31
 2022
 our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations
 capital expenditures
 dividends
 repayment of outstanding borrowings
 milestone and royalty payments
 the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act
 leases
 unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds
 and retirement benefits (see Notes 11
 4
 14
 10
 7
 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.
In 2022
 we committed to invest over several years more than $2 billion in two new facilities in Lebanon
 Indiana to manufacture existing and future products
 more than $1 billion in a new facility in Concord
 North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices
 and more than 400 million euro in a new facility in Limerick
 Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients. In early 2023
 we committed to invest an additional $450 million to expand manufacturing capacity at Research Triangle Park facility in Durham
 North Carolina for additional parenteral filling
 device assembly
 and packaging capacity. These investments
 and other capital investments that support our operations
 will result in higher capital expenditures for the next several years.
The 2017 Tax Act contained a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022
 whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. The implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. While the implementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes
" the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period. See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Tax Matters"" for additional information."
Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $2.07 billion as of December 31
 2022
 compared with $3.82 billion at December 31
 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.08 billion in 2022
 compared with $7.26 billion in 2021. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31
 2022 and 2021.
In addition to our cash and cash equivalents
 we held total investments of $3.05 billion and $3.30 billion as of December 31
 2022 and 2021
 respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In December 2022
 we acquired all shares of Akouos
 Inc. (Akouos) for a purchase price that included $12.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $327.2 million
 net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Akouos shareholders up to an additional $3.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $122 million) payable
 subject to certain terms and conditions
 upon the achievement of certain specified milestones. This acquisition was funded through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As of December 31
 2022
 total debt was $16.24 billion
 a decrease of $646.1 million compared with $16.88 billion at December 31
 2021. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
As of December 31
 2022
 we had a total of $7.33 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities
 $7.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.
Dividends of $3.92 per share and $3.40 per share were paid in 2022 and 2021
 respectively. The quarterly dividend was increased to $1.13 per share effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023
 resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2023 of $4.52 per share.
Capital expenditures were $1.85 billion during 2022
 compared to $1.31 billion in 2021.
In 2022
 we repurchased $1.50 billion of shares under our $5.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in May 2021. As of December 31
 2022
 we had $3.25 billion remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
"See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent losses of patent protection."
Both domestically and abroad
 we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers
 including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international government funding levels.
In the normal course of business
 our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates
 currency values
 and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations impact the costs of financing
 investing
 and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.
Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures
 we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31
 2022
 substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 10 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31
 2022 and 2021
 including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments
 a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31
 2022 and 2021
 respectively
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.
Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro
 Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro
 the Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset
 in part
 the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31
 2022 and 2021
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.
Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31
 2022 and 2021
 our carrying values of these investments were $1.16 billion and $1.83 billion
 respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net
 (income) expense by $232.4 million and $365.6 million as of December 31
 2022 and 2021
 respectively.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures
 or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g.
 approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement
 we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained.
Individually
 these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However
 if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period
 the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows
 respectively
 in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product
 which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however
 we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.
As we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our incretin products
 we have entered
 and expect to continue to enter
 into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could
 under certain circumstances
 require us to pay up to approximately $4.5 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services over the durations of the agreements
 which generally range from 2 to 8 years.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses
 and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex
 and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make
 it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that
 given current facts and circumstances
 it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations
 financial position
 or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Return
 Rebate
 and Discount Accruals
Background and Uncertainties
We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts
 product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers
 provisions for returns
 rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer
 we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 and chargeback programs
 as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs
 in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount
 we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs
 as well as patient assistance program costs
 by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g.
 patent expiries and product launches)
 an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs
 the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs
 and our product pricing.
Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return
 rebate
 and discount accruals.
Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration
 as well as royalties
 upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.
Financial Statement Impact
We believe that our accruals for sales returns
 rebates
 and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31
 2022
 a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $464 million.
The portion of our consolidated sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31
 2022 and 2021.
The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability balances
 including managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 chargeback
 and patient assistance programs:

Adjustments of the estimates for these returns
 rebates
 and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented.
Increase in reduction of net sales in 2022 was primarily driven by our incretin products due to increase in our patient assistance programs and in volume of rebates for managed care
 Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies
Background and Uncertainties
Litigation liabilities and other contingencies are
 by their nature
 uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation
 the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters
 the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation
 as applicable
 and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions
 if any. In addition
 we accrue for certain liability claims incurred
 but not filed
 to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage.
We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage
 we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions
 the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company
 the financial condition of the insurers
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance
 we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage
 we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights
 these considerations include the nature of the indemnification
 the financial condition of the indemnifying party
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection.
The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets
 respectively
 on our consolidated balance sheets.
Acquisitions
Background and Uncertainties
To determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition
 we make certain judgments
 which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules.
If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets
 where applicable
 is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business
 the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and
 therefore
 any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to acquired IPR&D and development milestones on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date
 and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
 as well as estimated asset lives
 can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets
 including acquired IPR&D
 are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include
 but are not limited to
 probability of technical success
 revenue projections
 and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances
 we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.
"The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis
 as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments
 including
 but not limited to
 probability of technical success and the discount rate.
Financial Statement Impact
As of December 31
 2022
 a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $5.5 million.

Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets
Background and Uncertainties
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified
 a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value
 and the cost basis is adjusted.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually
 or more frequently if impairment indicators are present
 by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount
 a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.
Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D
" all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
For acquired IPR&D assets
 the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product
" as discussed previously in ""—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such"
 it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.
Estimates of future cash flows
 based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections
 require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
Retirement Benefits Assumptions
Background and Uncertainties
Defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate
 expected return on plan assets
 and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below
 see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.
Annually
 we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined
 plan-specific yield curve of high quality
 fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets
 we consider many factors
 with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions
 asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments)
 and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results
 as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies
 where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption
 we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.
Annually
 we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 50 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively
 alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty
 adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values
 discounted cash flows valuations
 comparable market valuations
 and adjustments for currency
 credit
 liquidity and other risks.

Financial Statement Impact
If the 2022 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by $23.8 million. If the 2022 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by $33.5 million. If our assumption regarding the 2022 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year
 our income before income taxes would be affected by $46.3 million. The U.S. plans
 including Puerto Rico
 represent approximately 85 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31
 2022.
Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred
 along with other actuarial gains and losses
 and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.
Income Taxes
Background and Uncertainties
We file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations
 and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities
 which could result in future tax
 interest
 and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law
 the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities
 new information obtained during a tax examination
 or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets
 primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses
 tax credits
 and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets
 we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.
Financial Statement Impact
As of December 31
 2022
 a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $85.0 million and $38.8 million
 respectively.
