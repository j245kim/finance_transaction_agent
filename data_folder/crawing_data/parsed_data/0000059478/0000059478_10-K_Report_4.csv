 we
 or us) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis
 Indiana
 in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover
 develop
 manufacture
 and market products in a single business segment—human pharmaceutical products.
Our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world. Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists
 and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative new medicines.
We manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the United States (U.S.)
 including Puerto Rico
 and 7 other countries. Our products are sold in approximately 120 countries.

U.S.
We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other health care professionals. We also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways
 including promoting in online health care channels
 distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians
 and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition
 we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S.
 and we maintain websites and other media channels with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need.
We maintain special business groups to service wholesalers
 pharmacy benefit managers
 managed care organizations
 group purchasing organizations
 government and long-term care institutions
 hospitals
 and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products.
In the U.S.
 most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies
 physicians and other health care professionals
 and hospitals. In 2021
 2020
 and 2019
 three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation
 AmerisourceBergen Corporation
 and Cardinal Health
 Inc.—each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years.
Outside the U.S.
Outside the U.S.
 we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and other health care channels. While the products we market vary from country to country
 diabetes products constitute the largest single group of our consolidated revenue. Distribution patterns for our products also vary from country to country. In most countries in which we operate
 we maintain our own sales organizations
 but in some smaller countries we market our products through third-party distributors
 some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.
Marketing Collaborations
Certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies.  For example
 we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products
 including Trajenta

Competition
Our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.
Important competitive factors include effectiveness
 safety
 and ease of use; formulary placement
 price
 and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products
 processes
 modalities
 and uses. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded
 biosimilar
 or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages
 including by developing new modalities
 our products become subject to decreased sales
 progressive price reductions
 or both.
We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative
 cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers
 and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products
 and it is possible that our products will be
 or will become
 uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors.

Generic Pharmaceuticals
One of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S. and Europe
 the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy
 allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result
 generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly
 when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity
 it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product
 which can cause us to lose a significant portion of the product's revenue in a very short period of time.
Further
 public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow
 and in many cases require
 pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory
 it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In many countries outside the U.S.
 intellectual property protection is weak
 and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.
Biosimilars
A number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S.
 the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 the Public Health Service Act
 and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly's biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics
 also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that
 due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic
 may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors
" including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety"
 purity
 and potency.
Globally
 most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics
 including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA and in Europe. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. However
 in the U.S.
" the product exclusivity period under the BPCIA could be affected by recent government proposals and litigation. See ""- Patents"
 Trademarks
" and Other Intellectual Property Rights."" In addition"
 the extent to which a biosimilar
 once approved
 will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear
 and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S.
" currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" by the FDA will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable"
 the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient
 and if the product is administered more than once in a patient
" that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The FDA has begun to issue ""interchangeable"" designations for biosimilar products."
Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. For example
 a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro that competes with our product Humalog. On the other hand
 in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim
 we developed Basaglar
 an insulin glargine product
 which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a follow-on biologic in the U.S.
 and as a biosimilar in Europe and Japan. However
 in March 2020
" the FDA began regulating all of our insulin products as ""biologics"" rather than ""drugs."" Based on FDA draft guidance"
 this change may lessen the amount of data required for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market
 some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at U.S. pharmacies. For example
 in June 2020
 the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for Semglee
 a follow-on insulin glargine product that competes with Basaglar in the U.S.
 and
 in July 2021
 Semglee received additional FDA approval as a biosimilar that is interchangeable to its reference insulin glargine product. The FDA's interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and
 therefore
 the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty.

U.S. Private Sector Dynamics
In the U.S. private sector
 consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans
 managed care organizations
 pharmacy benefit managers
 wholesalers
 and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer
 larger entities
 thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers
 as well as governments
 typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion.
Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions
 such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions
 or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost
 such as non-preferred co-pay tiers
 increased co-insurance levels
 and higher deductibles. Consequently
 pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in pricing and usage negotiation
 and compete fiercely for formulary placement
 not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy
 safety profile
 or patient ease of use
 but also by providing rebates. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and pricing
 value-based agreements
 where pricing is based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes
 are another tool that may become increasingly prevalent. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions
 particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. We expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement
 changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products

Patents
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Overview
Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines. We own
 have applied for
 or are licensed under
 a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products
 product uses
 formulations
 and manufacturing processes. In addition
 as discussed below
 for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.
The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent)
 particularly those in major markets such as the U.S.
 major European countries
 and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications
 usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the Discovery Phase of the drug discovery process
" which is described in the ""Research and Development"" section below. In general"
 national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application
 which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:
•
Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
•
Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To make up for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process
 a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration
 and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency. For example
 Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Also
 in Japan
 South Korea
 and Australia
 patent terms can be extended up to five years
 depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors.

Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals
 especially for non-biologic products
 typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product
 which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However
 in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic
 biosimilar
 or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets
 later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes
 methods of use or formulations
 or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:
•
Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example
 the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below)
 effectively 10 years in Europe
 and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.
•
Under the BPCIA
 the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law
 the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic
 subject to certain conditions.
•
In the U.S.
 the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted
" this ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity"
 which is added to the term of data protection and
 for products other than biologics
 to the term of any relevant patents
 to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent
 pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity—i.e.
 a bar to generic or biosimilar approval
 not a patent right.
•
Under the U.S. orphan drug law
" a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200"
000 people in the U.S.
 or affecting more than 200
000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits
 orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity
 meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity
 the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.
Outside the major markets
 the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely
 and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization
" more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of ""flexibilities"" allowed under the agreement. Thus"
 some types of patents
 such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules
 are not available in certain developing countries. Further
 many developing countries
 and some developed countries
 do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in TRIPs.
Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
We consider intellectual property protection for certain products
 processes
 uses
 and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed below—to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below
 we may hold patents on manufacturing processes

Patent Challenges
In the U.S.
 the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984
 commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act
 authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics
 which are discussed below in more detail) when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA
" the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only ""pharmaceutical equivalence"" and ""bioequivalence"" between the generic version and the NDA-approved drug—not safety and efficacy. Establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company."
Absent a patent challenge
 the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However
 after the innovator has marketed its product for four years
" a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovator's NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a ""Paragraph IV certification."" If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer"
 the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company's application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are challenged
 the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers.
Generic manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition
" generic companies have shown willingness to launch ""at risk"
""" i.e."
 after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.
Under the BPCIA
 the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires
 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic
 and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However
 the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.
The patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA
 and the BPCIA itself
 is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA as well as courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. Further
 in the U.S.
" the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. See also ""- Competition - Biosimilars."" In addition"
 there is a procedure in U.S. patent law
 known as inter partes review (IPR)
 which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition
 the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators. We expect additional changes to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB)
" including potentially to the policy to discretionarily deny an otherwise meritorious petition for IPR in light of a concurrent district court proceeding.

Government Regulation of Our Operations
Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national
 state
 and local agencies.
Regulation of Products
The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing
 data analysis
 manufacturing development
 and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation. In addition
 our operations are subject to complex federal
 state
 local
 and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers
 the environment
 occupational health and safety
 data privacy
 and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations
 including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery
 development
 and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort
 expense
 and capital investment.
Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act
 the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing
 safety
 effectiveness
 manufacturing
 quality control
 distribution
 labeling
 marketing
 promotion
 advertising
 dissemination of information
 and post-marketing surveillance of those products.
Following approval
 our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling
 import
 export
 storage
 recordkeeping
 advertising
 promotion
 and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market. The FDA strictly regulates marketing
 labeling
 advertising
 and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under its cGMP regulations. Outside the U.S.
 our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements
 notably by the EMA in Europe
 the Ministry of Health
 Labor and Welfare in Japan
 and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Regulatory requirements and approval processes outside the U.S. may differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks.
We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive
 company-wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing
 product development
 and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cGMP and similar regulations. However
 in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements
 we become subject to potential government investigations
 regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in new product approvals
 and reputational harm
 any of which would adversely affect our business. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties
 and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us
 including through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business.
We are also subject to a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign environmental
 health and safety
 and other laws and regulations that may affect our research
 development or production efforts.

Emergency Use Authorizations
The Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize unapproved medical products to be manufactured
 marketed
 and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. After an emergency has been announced
 the Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize EUAs for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute
 including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing
 treating
 or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases when there are no adequate
 approved
 and available alternatives. An EUA is subject to additional conditions and restrictions
 such as the obligation to provide fact sheets for healthcare providers administering the product and those to whom it is administered
 adverse event monitoring and reporting
 and recordkeeping and reporting requirements by product manufacturers. The FDA may also establish additional discretionary conditions of authorization that the FDA deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health
 including conditions related to product distribution
 product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product. In issuing an EUA
 the FDA considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality
 safety and efficacy
 including the known and potential risks of such products and the adequacy and availability of approved alternatives
 among other factors. An EUA is not a substitute for obtaining FDA approval
 licensure
 or clearance for use of a product. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates
 and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances
 the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict.
Outside the U.S.
 the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that differ from those in the U.S.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination
 the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA has granted EUAs for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together
 baricitinib
 and bebtelovimab
 and similar actions have been taken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. However
 the FDA has revised
 and may in the future revise
 any EUA for our COVID-19 antibodies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy. For example
 in January 2022
 the FDA revised the EUA for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to limit their use to only when the patient is likely to have been infected with or exposed to a variant that is susceptible to this combination treatment.
Other Laws and Regulations
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws
 as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations
 including the federal anti-kickback statute
 the False Claims Act
 and state laws governing kickbacks
 false claims
 unfair trade practices
 and consumer protection. These laws are administered by
 among others
 the Department of Justice
 the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
 the Federal Trade Commission
 the Office of Personnel Management
 and state attorneys general. Over the past several years
 state
 federal
 and foreign governments
 agencies
 and other regulatory bodies have increased their oversight
 enforcement activities
 and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies
 which has resulted in intensified scrutiny
 corporate criminal sanctions
 and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.
In December 2020
 the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued final rules expanding and modifying existing
 and adding new
" regulatory ""safe harbors"" and exceptions"
 respectively
 under the anti-kickback statute and the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act. We are currently evaluating the impact
 if any
 these regulatory amendments will have upon becoming effective on our consolidated results of operations
 liquidity
 and financial position
 which is uncertain at this time.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities
 including U.S. publicly traded companies
 from promising
 offering
 or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above
 outside the U.S.
 our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Additionally
 in many countries outside the U.S.
 healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore
 our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.
14
14
14
""
""
In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA
 the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years
 several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area
 increased their enforcement activities
 and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.
We are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions
 which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act)
 criminal sanctions
 and administrative remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other health care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations
 liquidity
 and financial position.
We are also subject to a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign environmental
 health and safety
 and other laws and regulations that may affect our research
 development or production efforts.
Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
U.S.
There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing
 and measures to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals are being considered at various levels of state and federal government. In addition
 U.S. government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs
 including Medicare and Medicaid
 may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products. Additionally
 there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products
 which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to
 among other things
 bring more transparency to product pricing
 review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results. For example
 in January 2022
 the CMS proposed a national coverage determination (NCD) decision memorandum stating that the proposed NCD would cover FDA approved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease for people with Medicare only if they are enrolled in qualifying clinical trials (the Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody NCD). If finalized in its current form
 the proposed Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody NCD would result in reduced coverage for
 and negatively impact
 our product candidate donanemab
 and may negatively impact our business and financial results. The regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration could further intensify these efforts
 which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In the U.S.
 we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs
" including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of health care facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B facilities). No rebates are required at this time in the Medicare Part B (physician and hospital outpatient) program where reimbursement is set on an ""average sales price plus 4.3 percent"" formula. Additionally"
 an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. Since 2019
 the Bipartisan Budget Act has required manufacturers of brand-name drugs
 biologics
" and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the ""doughnut hole"" (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage)."
Rebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the anti-kickback statute's discount safe harbor
 which have currently been stayed until at least January 1
 2026. Pending legislation could repeal the amendments to the discount safe harbor. Accordingly
 their impact on our business is uncertain at this time.
15
15
15
""
""
Outside the U.S.
Globally
 public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value
 including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition
 third-party organizations
 including professional associations
 academic institutions
 and non-profit entities associated with payers
 are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines
 the impact of which are uncertain at this time.
In most international markets
 we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs
 which may include price controls
 international reference pricing (to other countries' prices)
 discounts and rebates
 therapeutic reference pricing (to other
 often generic
 pharmaceutical choices)
 restrictions on physician prescription levels
 and mandatory generic substitution. We may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.
We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative
 regulatory
 or payer developments. However
 in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional state
 federal
 and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products.

 and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.
Research and Development
Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2021
 we employed approximately 8
100 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities
 including a substantial number of physicians
 scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees
 and highly skilled technical personnel.
Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of diabetes
 immunology
 neuroscience
 and oncology. During the past two years
 we have also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines
 we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses
 formulations
 and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients.
To supplement our internal efforts
 we collaborate with others
 including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians
 hospitals
 medical schools
 and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including
 among others
 licensing arrangements
 co-development agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 joint ventures
 acquisitions
 and equity investments.
Pharmaceutical development is time-consuming
 expensive
 and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process
 and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:
Phases of New Drug Development
•
Discovery Phase
In the discovery phase
 scientists identify
 design
 and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development
 which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.
16
16
16
""
""
•
Early Development Phase
Early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals
 as necessary. In general
 the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently
 larger populations of patients are studied (Phase II) to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel
 scientists work to identify safe
 effective
 and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase
 approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete.
•
Late Development Phase
Late phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result
 these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies
 placebo
 or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take two to four years.
•
Submission Phase
Once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies
 the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years
 depending on the disease state
 the strength and complexity of available data
 the degree of unmet need
 and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission
 which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval
 or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
We believe our investments in research
 both internally and in collaboration with others
 have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development. We currently have approximately
45 new medicine
candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review
 and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline"
""" for more information on certain of our product candidates."
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However
 we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented
 in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product. However
 various developments from time to time lead to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources or
 in some cases
 implement alternative processes.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S.
 including Puerto Rico
 and Ireland. Finishing operations
 including formulation
 filling
 assembling
 delivery device manufacturing
 and packaging
 take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations.
We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities
 contracted arrangements
 and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet substantially all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain a stable supply of our products
 we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems
 inventory management
 and back-up sites.
17

""
""
However
 pharmaceutical production processes are complex
 highly regulated
 and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures
 process modifications
 and regulatory approvals. Accordingly
 developments such as unplanned plant shutdowns
 manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities
 failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 increases in demand on a supplier
 or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products
 from time to time lead to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products or product shortages. Further
 global transportation and logistics challenges
 as well as tight labor markets
 have caused
 and in the future may cause
 delays in
 and/or increase costs related to
 distribution of our medicines
 the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity
 procurement activity
 and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. For more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties
 disruptions
 and shortages in the manufacturing
 distribution
 and sale of our products
" see ""Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Manufacturing and supply chain difficulties"
 disruptions
" or shortages could lead to product supply problems."""
In addition
 the strain on global transportation
 logistics
 and labor markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials have had
 and may continue to have
 a number of impacts on our business
 including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and disruptions in the supply of our medicines. For more information
 see Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations. We are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic"
 epidemic
" or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future."" and Item 7"
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - COVID-19 Pandemic."""
Quality Assurance
Our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations
 including research and development
 purchasing
 facilities planning
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and dissemination of information about our medicines.
Quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients
 equipment
 facilities
 manufacturing methods
 packaging materials
 and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses
 microbiological testing
 testing in animals
 or a combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers.
Executive Officers of the Company
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers.
The term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors
 to be held on May 2
 2022 in connection with the company's annual meeting of shareholders
" or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified. No director or executive officer has a ""family relationship"" with any other director or executive officer of the company"
 as that term is defined for purposes of this disclosure requirement. There is no understanding between any executive officer or director and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was selected.

Human Capital Management
Our core values—integrity
 excellence
 and respect for people—shape our approach to attracting
 retaining
 engaging
 and developing a highly skilled and ethical workforce
 which is critical to executing our strategy. We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance
 most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists
 and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative new medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success.
We are committed to creating a safe
 supportive
 ethical
 and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital management process
 fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices
 robust training and development opportunities
 and competitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to promoting diversity
 equity
 and inclusion (DEI) within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business success and growth.
We regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders in order to implement changes to our policies and benefits designed to improve our employees' well-being. As a result of our efforts
 we believe that we have a highly performing
 cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.
At the end of 2021
 we employed approximately 35
000 people
 including approximately 19
600 employees outside the U.S. Our employees include approximately 8
100 people engaged in research and development activities.
Strategy and Oversight
In order to build diverse and inclusive teams
 our CEO and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders accountable for achieving results. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance
 our board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract
 retain
 engage
 and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission.
Diversity
 Equity
 and Inclusion
We are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices
 and we deeply value diverse backgrounds
 skills
 and global perspectives. To fulfill our purpose
 we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse experiences of the patients who depend on us.
We believe that fostering DEI begins with understanding. For example
 our
Employee Journeys
research has yielded important insights about the experiences of women
 Black/African American
 Latinx
 Asian
 and LGBTQ+ employees at Lilly. The results of this research are reviewed by our senior leadership
 and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture.
In 2020
 as part of our DEI and community initiatives
 Lilly and the Lilly Foundation launched the Racial Justice Commitment and pledged $25 million and 25
000 volunteer hours over five years to help decrease the burden of racial injustice and its effects on communities of color. The Racial Justice Commitment aims to drive change across five areas: internal people development
 health equity
 social impact
 diversity partners
 and family sustaining jobs
 through the use of financial and people resources. In 2021
 we made progress in these efforts
 including through the development of two apprenticeship programs at Lilly for individuals without college degrees.
Since 2017
 we have committed to increasing the number of women
 Black/African American
 Latinx
 and Asian populations in leadership roles
 and we actively monitor our progress. From the end of 2017 through the end of 2021
 we increased the percentage of women in management globally from 41 percent to 48 percent. For minority group members (MGM) in the U.S. over the same period
 we increased management representation from 16 percent to 24 percent. Across all levels of our workforce
 from the end of 2017 through the end of 2021
 we have seen increased representation for MGMs in the U.S. and women globally. Our focus on DEI is also evident at our executive committee and board of directors. Five of 15 current members (approximately 33 percent) of our executive committee (which includes our CEO) are women and two are MGM. In addition
 as of the filing of this report
 the company's 13-member board of directors includes four women and six members who are MGMs.

Employee Development
We believe talent begins with the hiring process. We therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions. We believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers.
We offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry. We also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences
 helping them build rewarding careers. We have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings. Many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs. Across Lilly
 we are working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective. In addition
 we have implemented tools and resources and improved our talent programs and processes to provide broad access to information and transparency regarding career development and advancement at Lilly.
In early 2022
 we launched
Discover
""
 a 12-month new employee onboarding program with multiple touchpoints designed to foster integration into the Lilly culture
 to accelerate learning in their new roles and to create connections to further a sense of belonging at Lilly.
Discover
was shaped in part by external benchmarking
 feedback from employees
 and learnings from onboarding remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employee resource groups (ERGs) are another important component of developing talent at Lilly. We currently have 11 ERGs representing groups including women
 MGMs
 LGBTQ+ individuals
 veterans
 and people with disabilities. ERGs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build relationships
 engage with senior leaders
 advance our caring community
 and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business.
We have continued our efforts to create an inclusive workplace with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and share their ideas at work. Our
Make it Safe to Thrive
education and awareness program is designed to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced and includes live and online training and a monthly video series.
Lilly is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and respect in the workplace—an environment free of discrimination
 harassment
 or retaliation of any kind. In 2022
 as part of our annual review of The Red Book (Lilly's comprehensive code of business conduct applicable to our board and all employees worldwide) and related policies and procedures
 we revised the Global Conduct in the Workplace procedure to continue to help ensure that we maintain a respectful
 safe
 inclusive
 and professional workplace.
Employee Health and Safety
We strive to foster a healthy
 vibrant work environment
 which includes keeping our employees safe. We seek to create a companywide culture where best-in-class safety practices are consistently followed. To do this
 we assess and continuously attempt to improve our companywide safety performance to promote the well-being of employees and to help safeguard communities where we operate. As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved
 we have taken various measures to protect and support the health and safety of our employees globally
 including instituting travel restrictions and work-from-home arrangements
 offering onsite testing and vaccination options where possible
 and instituting safety precautions such as masking
 social distancing
 and enhanced cleaning practices. To support employee well-being in the U.S.
 we also enhanced local benefits related to health care
 childcare
 and time off. We believe this holistic approach and dedication to safety helps us be our best as we deliver on our company purpose to improve lives around the world.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. It is possible that our business
 financial condition
 liquidity
 cash flows
 or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation.
Risks Related to Our Business
•
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations. We are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic
 epidemic
 or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide. The focus of resources on COVID-19
 widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of COVID-19
 and the resulting strain on global transportation
 manufacturing
 and labor markets have negatively impacted development
 manufacturing
 supply
 distribution
 and sales of our medicines.
Although in-person interactions with healthcare professionals have largely resumed
" we continue to see a lack of ""normal"" access and fewer in-person interactions by patients and our employees with healthcare professionals. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop"
 we may decide to halt such in-person interactions in the future and
 in those cases
 expect to resume such interactions as it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirements.
The strain on global transportation
 logistics
 and labor markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply have had
 and may continue to have
 a number of impacts on our business
 including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and disruptions and shortages in the supply of our medicines. These factors may negatively affect our results of operations.
We also face risks and uncertainties related to our COVID-19 therapies
 including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations
 restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies
 and risks related to handling
 return
 and/or refund of product after delivery by us. In addition
 expedited authorization processes have allowed restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data
 and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies. The availability of superior or competitive therapies
 including therapies that can be administered more easily
 or preventative measures such as vaccines
 coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics
 have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. We also expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited. Mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus have in some cases impacted the effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies
 and may further render our therapies more or less effective or ineffective. Furthermore
 the FDA has revised
 and may in the future revise
 any EUA for our COVID-19 therapies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our therapies have varying degrees of efficacy. These and other risks related to COVID-19 could affect other aspects of our business or intensify other risks inherent in our business
 including potentially resulting in delays or denials in the approval or launch of other products or indications.
It remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control
 including
 but not limited to
 the duration and severity of the pandemic
 the actions taken to reduce its transmission
 including widespread availability and efficacy of vaccines
 the introduction and spread of new variants of the coronavirus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines
 the continuation of existing or implementation of new government restrictions and the speed with which
 and extent to which
 more stable economic and operating conditions resume. Should the COVID-19 pandemic
 or any future pandemic
 epidemic
 or similar public health threat
 and any associated supply chain disruption

Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing
 licensing
 or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.
There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development
 the introduction of new products
 and business development activities to enhance our product pipeline.
There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 limited scope of approved uses
 label changes
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications.
We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether
 if initially granted
 such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop
 license
 or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products
 once launched
 will be commercially successful.
We must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products
 both through our internal efforts and our business development activities
 sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 cash flows
 and financial position.
We engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline
 including licensing arrangements
 co-development agreements
 co-promotion arrangements
 joint ventures
 acquisitions
 and equity investments. There are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry
 including by the Federal Trade Commission
 and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay
 jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition
 failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses
 products
 or assets we acquire (including related technology
 commercial operations
 compliance programs
 manufacturing
 distribution
 and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to developments outside our control
 including unsuccessful clinical trials
 issues related to the quality
 integrity
 or broad applicability of data
 regulatory impediments
 and commercialization challenges. Accordingly
 business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all)
 may not result in successful commercialization of any product
 and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny.
See Item 1
" ""Business - Research and Development - Phases of New Drug Development"" and Item 7"

We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues
 cash flows
 and earnings; we have lost or soon will lose effective intellectual property protection for a number of our products
 which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues.
A number of our products
 including Alimta and Forteo
 have recently lost
 or soon will lose
 significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S. as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S. We have faced
 and remain exposed to
 generic competition following the loss of such intellectual property protection. In particular
 we expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta in the U.S. following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
Certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic products
 loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors
 leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues
 especially in the U.S. For biologics (such as Humalog
 Humulin
 Erbitux
 Cyramza
 Trulicity
 Taltz
 and Emgality)
 loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e.
 biosimilars) due to many factors
 including development timelines
 manufacturing challenges
 and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. Generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation.
There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover
 patents relating to particular products
 uses
 formulations
 or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them
 or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"
""" and Item 1"
" ""Business - Patents"
 Trademarks
 and Other Intellectual Property Rights
""" for more details."
•
Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated
 circumvented
 or weakened
 our business will be adversely affected.
Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative new medicines. Without strong intellectual property protection
 we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development
 as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time
 depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products. In the U.S.
 in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA
 which applies to biologic products
 the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering pharmaceutical products. As a result
 we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products
 including biologics
 will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition
 a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. However
 if our patents are challenged through this expedited review process
 even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent
 our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court
 meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition
 competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful
 such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. In addition
 intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face additional risks to our intellectual property rights
 including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch. See Item 1

We and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers
 and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 and generic pharmaceutical companies and
 in many cases
 our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully
 we must continue to deliver to the market innovative
 cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace
 by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products
 and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.
Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars
 recent health authority guidelines and legislative proposals could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. In the U.S.
" the FDA has begun issuing ""interchangeability"" designations for biosimilar products"
 which could – subject to state law requirements – enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for innovator biological products. Given the importance of biologic products to our clinical-stage pipeline
 such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1
" ""Business - Competition"" and ""Business - Research and Development"
""" for more details."
In addition
 we rely on our ability to attract
 engage
 and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel in order to compete effectively. To continue to commercialize our products
 and advance the research
 development
 and commercialization of additional modalities and product candidates
 we may need to expand our workforce
 including in the areas of manufacturing
 clinical trials management
 regulatory affairs
 and sales and marketing
 both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies
 biotechnology companies
 academic and other research institutions
 as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities
 which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly competitive environment may be further complicated by evolving employment trends arising from the COVID-19 pandemic
 including vaccination mandates
 increased preferences for remote
 alternative
 or flexible work arrangements
 and other factors. Our failure to compete effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future approved products
 and could result in material financial
 legal
 commercial
 or reputational harm to our business.
•
Failure
 inadequacy
 breach of
 or unauthorized access to
 our IT systems or those of our third-party service providers
 unauthorized access to our confidential information
 or violations of data protection laws
 could each result in material harm to our business and reputation.
A great deal of confidential information owned by us or our business partners or other third parties is stored in our information systems
 networks
 and facilities or those of third parties. This includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property
 clinical trial information
 corporate strategic plans
 marketing plans
 customer information
 and personally identifiable information
 such as employee and patient information (collectively
 confidential information). We also rely
 to a large extent
 on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems
 infrastructure
 and hardware (together
 IT systems)
 some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties
 to accumulate
 process
 store
 and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy
 data protection
 and data security. Maintaining the security
 confidentiality
 integrity and availability of our IT systems and confidential information is vital to our business. Our failure
 or the failure of our third party service providers
 to protect and maintain the security
 confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of our (or their) IT systems and our confidential information and other data could significantly harm our reputation as well as result in significant costs
 including those related to fines
 litigation
 and obligations to comply with applicable data breach laws.

IT systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies
 operating failures
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. Cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency
 sophistication
 and intensity
 and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect
 mitigate
 or prevent. Cyber-attacks come in many forms
 including the deployment of harmful malware
 exploitation of vulnerabilities (including those of third-party software or systems)
 denial-of-service attacks
 the use of social engineering
 and other means to compromise the confidentiality
 integrity and availability of our IT systems
 confidential information
 and other data. Breaches resulting in the compromise
 disruption
 degradation
 manipulation
 loss
 theft
 destruction
 or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information
 or the unauthorized access to
 disruption of

 products and services
 can occur in a variety of ways
 including but not limited to
 negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information
 or wrongful conduct by hackers
 competitors
 certain governments or nation-states
 or other current or former company personnel. Our third-party partners
 including third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services
 as well as suppliers
 distributors
 alliances
 and other third parties with whom we may share data
 face similar risks
 which could affect us directly or indirectly. The healthcare industry has been and continues to be a target for cyber-attacks
 and the number of threats has only increased over time. Numerous federal agencies that monitor and regulate internet and cyber-crime have issued guidance
 alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching
 malicious actors targeting healthcare related systems and nation-state sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information.

 customer relationships
 or reputation; result in unfavorable clinical trial results by virtue of incorrect or unreliable data; and/or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. Unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company. In addition
 IT system security in jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weaker and may result in additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks.

•
Significant economic downturns or international trade and other global disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results.
While pharmaceuticals have generally been less sensitive to overall economic cycles
 prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products
 affecting our sales volume. Declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending
 leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. Additionally
 some customers
 including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding
 may be unable to pay for our products in a timely manner. Also
 if our customers
 suppliers
 or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties
 we could experience slower customer collections
 greater bad debt expense
 and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. Similarly
 in the event of a significant economic downturn
 we could have difficulty accessing credit markets.

Significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe
 including the United Kingdom
 in Asia
 including China
 and in other international geographies. Trade and other global disputes and interruptions in international relationships
 including related to tariffs
 trade protection measures
 import or export licensing requirements
 the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments
 unrest or war
 as well as pandemic diseases
 such as COVID-19
 affect our ability to do business. For example
 tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland
 as well as other business restrictions. These and similar events could adversely affect us
 or our business partners or customers.
•
Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns
 which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues
 income
 and reputation.
Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. After approval
 the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients. Accordingly
 we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. In addition
 we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have
 and could in the future
 result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. Safety issues have
 and could in the future
" result in costly product liability claims. See also "" - The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations. We are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic"
 epidemic
" or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future."""
•
We face litigation and investigations related to our products
 how we price our products
 and how we commercialize our products; we could face large numbers of claims in the future
 which could adversely affect our business
 and we are self-insured for such matters.
We are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving various current and historical products
 litigation and investigations related to how we commercialize and/or how we price our products
 including relating to our 340B drug pricing program
 as well as contractual disputes. See Item 8
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16"
" Contingencies"" for more information on our current product liability litigation"
 as well as pricing litigation
 investigations
 and inquiries. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products
 we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our previous
 current
 or future products
 or to further litigation or investigations
 including related to pricing or other commercial practices. Such matters could affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and
 if involving marketed products
 could adversely affect sales of the product. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance
 we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products
 as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters.
•
Manufacturing and supply chain difficulties
 disruptions
 or shortages could lead to product supply problems.
Pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. Manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities
 the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities
 or increases in demand on a supplier could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing
 distribution
 and sale of our products and/or product shortages
 leading to lost revenue. Further
 global transportation and logistics challenges
 as well as tight labor markets
 have caused
 and in the future may cause
 delays in
 and/or increase costs related to
 distribution of our medicines
 the construction or other acquisition of manufacturing capacity
 procurement activity
 and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. Such difficulties
 disruptions
 or challenges could result from quality
 oversight
 or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters or pandemic disease; equipment
 mechanical
 data
 or information technology system vulnerabilities
 such as system inadequacies
 inadequate controls or procedures
 operating failures
 service interruptions or failures
 security breaches
 malicious intrusions
 or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; labor shortages; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; or inability to obtain single-source or other raw or intermediate materials. In addition
 difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our

products and indications and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity from time to time result in difficulty meeting demand for
 or disruptions
 shortages
 and higher costs in the supply of
 our products. See Item 1
" ""Business - Raw Materials and Product Supply"

•
Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.
We rely on third parties
 including suppliers
 distributors
 alliances
 and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
 and third-party service providers
 for selected aspects of product and clinical development
 manufacturing
 commercialization
 hosting of
 and support for
 information technology systems
 product distribution
 and certain financial transactional processes. As examples
 we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality

Risks Related to Government Regulation
•
Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing
 reimbursement
 and access for our drugs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business.
Public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for
 and patient access to
 our medicines. These pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of
 and actions intended to address
 pricing
 reimbursement
 and access to pharmaceutical products. Additional policies
 regulations
 legislation
 or enforcement
 including as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide
 could adversely impact our business and revenue. For example
 pending legislation in the U.S. could result in government negotiation of the price of some of our medicines
 including insulin. Furthermore
 restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 or private payers
 such as the recently proposed Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody NCD
 may adversely impact our business and financial results. However
 we cannot predict the likelihood
 nature
 or extent of current and future health care reform efforts. We also may continue to experience potential additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.

Changes in foreign currency rates
 interest rate risks
 or inflation could materially affect our results of operations.
As a global company
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates
 and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques
 significant fluctuations in currency rates
 interest rates
 and inflation can have a material impact
 either positive or negative
 on our

""
results of operations. Further
 in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency
 the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. In addition
 the discontinuation
 modification
 or other reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
 or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate
 could increase our interest expense
 decrease our cash flows
 and/or require us to amend certain of our existing agreements. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition and Liquidity"" and Item 8"
" ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standard"" for more details."
•
Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions
 and in the course of our business
 we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events. Changes in tax laws
 regulations
 administrative practices
 principles
 and interpretations
 as well as events that differ from our expectations
 have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates
 cash flows
 and/or and results of operations. For example
 in December 2017
 the U.S. enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising U.S. tax laws
 and a number of other countries are also actively considering or enacting tax changes. Significant uncertainty currently exists regarding proposed tax policies of the current U.S. presidential administration and Congress
 including modifications to certain aspects of the 2017 tax law. In addition
 tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions
 which could unfavorably impact our results of operations. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Modifications to key elements of the current U.S. or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. See Item 7
" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters"" and Item 8"

•
Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.
""
The marketing
 promotional
 and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers
 as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers
 prescribers
 and patients
 are subject to extensive regulation. Many companies
 including us
 have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal
 state
 and foreign governmental authorities
 private payers
 and consumers. These claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. We are and could in the future become subject to such investigations
 the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines
 penalties
 or other monetary or non-monetary remedies
 including exclusion from U.S. federal and other health care programs. Such investigations have intensified and may continue to intensify as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide. In addition
 regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in the approvals of new products or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 and reputational harm
 any of which would adversely affect our business. Regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may also be less predictable and result in additional costs
 uncertainties
 and risks. See Item 1

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock Index and our peer group for the years 2017 through 2021. The graph assumes that
 on the last business day of 2016
 a person invested $100 each in Lilly stock
 the S&P 500 Stock Index
 and the peer group's collective common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return
 which takes into account both stock price and dividends. It assumes that dividends paid by a company are immediately reinvested in that company's stock.

Executive Overview
This section provides an overview of our financial results
 recent product and late-stage pipeline developments
 and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic
 we have focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for COVID-19; protecting the health
 safety
 and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines
 particularly insulin. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic
 and at the request of the United States (U.S.) and international governments
 we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk
 in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for baricitinib for treatment with or without remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the third quarter of 2021
 the FDA expanded the EUA for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to include post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited. In February 2022
 the FDA granted an EUA for bebtelovimab for certain high-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We have agreed with the U.S. government to supply up to 600
000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than March 31
 2022 for at least $720 million with an option of 500
000 additional doses no later than July 31
 2022. The FDA has revised
 and may in the future revise
 any EUA for our COVID-19 therapies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our therapies have varying degrees of efficacy.
The COVID-19 pandemic has
 and may continue to
 adversely impact our business and operations. The focus of resources on COVID-19
 widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of COVID-19
 and the resulting strain on global transportation
 manufacturing
 and labor markets have negatively impacted development
 manufacturing
 supply
 distribution
 and sales of our medicines. In addition to decreases in new prescriptions
 changes in payer segment mix
 and the increased use of patient affordability programs in the U.S.
 we have experienced
 and may continue to experience if the COVID-19 pandemic undergoes resurgent or more severe waves
" decreased demand as a result of lack of ""normal"" access and fewer in-person interactions by patients and our employees with healthcare professionals."

""
""
We also face risks and uncertainties related to our COVID-19 therapies
 including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations
 restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies
 and risks related to handling
 return
 and/or refund of product after delivery by us. The availability of superior or competitive therapies
 including therapies that can be administered more easily
 or preventative measures such as vaccines
 coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics
 have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. Mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus have in some cases impacted the effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies
 and may further render our therapies more or less effective or ineffective.
The strain on global transportation
 logistics
 and labor markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply have had
 and may continue to have
 a number of impacts on our business
 including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and potential disruptions in the supply of our medications. These factors may negatively affect our results of operations.
It remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control. We are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic
 epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future.
See Item 1A
" ""Risk Factors"" for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations."

NM - not meaningful
Revenue increased in 2021 driven by increased volume and
 to a lesser extent
 the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates
 partially offset by lower realized prices. Operating expenses
 defined as the sum of research and development and marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses
 increased in 2021
 driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. The decreases in net income and EPS in 2021 were driven primarily by reduction in other-net
 (income) expense and higher operating expenses
 partially offset by higher gross margin.

The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2021 and 2020 financial results:
2021
Cost of Sales (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized a net inventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies of $339.7 million. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic
 and at the request of the U.S. and international governments
 we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk
 in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved during 2021
 we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from U.S. and international governments
 including changes to our agreement with the U.S. government
 and near-term expiry dates of COVID-19 antibodies.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $874.9 million related to business development transactions.
Asset Impairment
 Restructuring
 and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized charges of $316.1 million primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo Oncology
 Inc. (Loxo)
 an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza
®
""
 as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail).
Other-Net
 (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt.
•
We recognized $176.9 million of net investment gains on equity securities.
2020
Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $660.4 million related to business development transactions.
Asset Impairment
 Restructuring
 and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized charges of $131.2 million primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure.
Other-Net
 (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)
•
We recognized $1.44 billion of net investment gains on equity securities.

Late-Stage Pipeline
Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire
 develop
 and commercialize innovative new medicines. We currently have approximately 45 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review
 and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase.
The following certain new molecular entities (NMEs) are currently in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S.
 Europe
 or Japan. The following table reflects the status of certain NMEs
 including certain other developments since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30
 2021.

There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products
 as well as a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process
 including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result
 most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns
 inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage
 limited scope of approved uses
 label changes
 changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products
 difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture
 or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition
 it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications.

We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in
 or termination of
 any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process
 we cannot reliably estimate the nature
 timing
 and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects
 nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline
 and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes
 we must make significant cost estimations and allocations
 some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore
 we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project
 by preclinical versus clinical spend
 or by therapeutic category.
Other Matters
Patent Matters
We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue
 cash flows
 and earnings.
In 2021
 our vitamin regimen patents for Alimta
®
expired worldwide. Following the loss of patent exclusivity in major European countries and Japan
 we faced
 and remain exposed to
 generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels. In the U.S.
 we expect pediatric data exclusivity to provide us with protection through May 2022. However
 we and Eagle Pharmaceuticals
 Inc. (Eagle) reached an agreement in December 2019 to settle all pending U.S. patent litigation
 allowing Eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting February 2022 (up to an approximate three-week supply) and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition in the U.S. following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending regarding
 among others
 our Alimta patents.
Our compound patent for Humalog
®
(insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A competitor has similar version of insulin lispro in the U.S. and in certain European markets. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market
 we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however
 we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that may continue over time.
Our formulation and use patents for Forteo
®
have expired in major markets. We expect further decline in revenue as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition due to the loss of patent exclusivity in major markets.
Our regulatory data and patent exclusivity for Cymbalta
®
expired in Japan. Beginning in mid-2021
 we have faced
 and remain exposed to
 generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
As a global company
 we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro
 Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques
 significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact
 either positive or negative
 on operating expenses. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates
 fluctuations in these rates could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing
 Reimbursement
 and Access
Global concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate
 as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures may include the use of mandated discounts
 price reporting requirements
 mandated reference prices
 restrictive formularies
 changes to available intellectual property protections
 as well as other efforts. In addition
 consolidation of private payors in the U.S. has significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore
 restrictive or unfavorable pricing
 coverage
 or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments
 regulatory agencies
 or private payers
 such as the recently proposed Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody national coverage determination
 may adversely impact our business and financial results. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products
 such as insulin
 as governments manage and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic
 which could adversely affect our business. In addition
 we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340B program that
 if resolved adversely to us
 could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.
In addition
 evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and our industry
 including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices
 quality assurance
 and similar regulations
 and increased focus on business combinations in our industry. Any regulatory issues concerning these matters could lead to regulatory and legal actions
 product recalls and seizures
 fines and penalties
 interruption of production leading to product shortages
 import bans or denials of import certifications
 delays or denials in the approvals of new products or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues
 impediments to the completion of business combinations
 and reputational harm
 any of which would adversely affect our business.

" ""Business - Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing"
 Reimbursement
" and Access"" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information."
Tax Matters
We are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore
 changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate
 results of operations
 and cash flows. In 2017
 the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act)
 which contains a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. Previously
 these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations
 if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress
 we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period.
The U.S. and countries around the world are actively considering and enacting tax law changes. Tax proposals introduced by Congress and the U.S. presidential administration contain significant changes
 including increases to the tax rates at which both domestic and foreign income of U.S. companies would be taxed. In addition
 tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions
 which could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Further
 actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate.

Acquisitions
We opportunistically invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms
 including acquisitions
 collaborations
 investments
 and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business.
In January 2021
 we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million
 net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable
 subject to certain terms and conditions
 upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S.
 Japan
 United Kingdom
 Germany
 France
 Italy
 or Spain. Under the terms of the agreement
 we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development
 extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets.
In February 2020
 we acquired all shares of Dermira
 Inc. for a purchase price of $849.3 million
 net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement
 we acquired lebrikizumab
 a novel
 investigational
 monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. We also acquired Qbrexza cloth
 a medicated cloth for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating). In 2021
 we sold the rights to Qbrexza. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of the rights to Qbrexza.
In February 2019
 we acquired all shares of Loxo for a purchase price of $6.92 billion
 net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement
 we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines
 including selpercatinib
 an oral RET inhibitor
 and LOXO-305 (pirtobrutinib)
 an oral BTK inhibitor. In the second quarter of 2020
 the FDA approved selpercatinib (Retevmo) under its Accelerated Approval regulations and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.

Revenue of Trulicity
 a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors
 increased 28 percent in the U.S.
 driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 26 percent
 driven by increased volume and
 to a lesser extent
 the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates
 partially offset by lower realized prices.
Revenue of Humalog
 an injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes
 decreased 11 percent in the U.S.
 primarily driven by lower realized prices. Humalog's lower realized prices in the U.S. in 2021 were driven by higher contracted rebates and discounts and increased utilization in more highly-rebated government segments
 partially offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent
 driven by decreased volume and
 to a lesser extent
 lower realized prices
 largely offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Included in the revenue of Humalog in the U.S. are our own insulin lispro authorized generics. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market
 we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue. However
 due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the U.S. and some international markets
 we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time.

Revenue of COVID-19 antibodies
 treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19 for higher-risk patients and for post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection
 was $1.98 billion in the U.S. during the year ended December 31
 2021. Revenue outside the U.S. was $261.4 million during the year ended December 31
 2021. The availability of superior or competitive therapies
 including therapies that can be administered more easily
 or preventative measures
 such as vaccines
 coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics
 have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for these COVID-19 antibodies. The FDA has revised
 and may in the future revise
 any EUA for our COVID-19 antibodies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy. We expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited.
Revenue of Taltz
 a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis
 active psoriatic arthritis
 ankylosing spondylitis
 and active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis
 increased 20 percent in the U.S.
 driven by increased demand
 partially offset by lower realized prices due to increased rebates to gain commercial access. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 34 percent
 primarily driven by increased volume.
Revenue of Alimta
 a treatment for various cancers
 decreased 2 percent in the U.S.
 driven by decreased volume
 partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 22 percent
 primarily driven by decreased volume due to the entry of generic competition in certain markets and
 to a lesser extent
 lower realized prices
 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Following the loss of exclusivity in major European countries and Japan in June 2021
 we faced
 and remain exposed to
 generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels. In the U.S.
" we expect the limited entry of generic competition starting February 2022 and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. See ""Executive Overview - Other Matters- Patent Matters"" for additional information."
Revenue of Jardiance
 a treatment for type 2 diabetes
 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease
 and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Gross Margin
 Costs
 and Expenses
Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 74.2 percent in 2021
 a decrease of 3.5 percentage points compared with 2020
 driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies.
Research and development expenses increased 15 percent to $7.03 billion in 2021
 primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets.
Marketing
 selling
 and administrative expenses increased 5 percent to $6.43 billion in 2021
 primarily due to increased marketing costs to continue to drive growth for certain products
 investment in preparation for new launches
 and lower marketing activities in 2020 as a result of pandemic-related spending reductions.
We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $874.9 million and $660.4 million in 2021 and 2020
 respectively
 related to business development transactions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
We recognized asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges of $316.1 million in 2021. The charges were primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo
 an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza
 as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail. In 2020
 we recognized $131.2 million of asset impairment
 restructuring
 and other special charges primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure.
Other—net
 (income) expense was expense of $201.6 million in 2021 compared to income of $1.17 billion in 2020
 primarily driven by lower net investment gains on equity securities and a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt.
Our effective tax rate was 9.3 percent in 2021
 compared with an effective tax rate of 14.3 percent in 2020
 primarily driven by the tax impacts of acquired IPR&D charges
 lower net investment gains on equity securities
 as well as a net discrete tax benefit.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
We believe our available cash and cash equivalents
 together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings
 are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements
 which include:
•
working capital requirements
 including related to employee payroll
 clinical trials
 manufacturing materials
 and taxes;
•
capital expenditures;
•
share repurchases and dividends;
•
repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;
•
contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;
•
milestone and royalty payments; and
•
potential business development activities
 including acquisitions
 collaborations
 investments
 and licensing arrangements.
Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources
 including our access to external capital
 to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31
 2021
 our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations
 capital equipment expenditures
 dividends
 repayment of outstanding borrowings
 milestone and royalty payments
 the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act
 leases
 unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds
 and retirement benefits (see Notes 11
 4
 14
 10
 7
 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.
Beginning in 2022
 the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes
 whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations
 if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress
" we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters"" for additional information."
We plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord
 North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick
 Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31
 2021
 compared with $3.66 billion at December 31
 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021
 compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31
 2021 and 2020.
In addition to our cash and cash equivalents
 we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31
 2021 and 2020
 respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In January 2021
 we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million
 net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable
 subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As of December 31
 2021
 total debt was $16.88 billion
 an increase of $289.4 million compared with $16.60 billion at December 31
 2020. In September 2021
 we issued euro-denominated notes consisting of €500.0 million of 1.125 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2051 and €700.0 million of 1.375 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2061
 with interest to be paid annually
 and British pound-denominated notes consisting of £250.0 million of 1.625 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2043
 with interest to be paid annually. We paid $1.91 billion of the net cash proceeds from the offering to purchase and redeem certain higher interest rate U.S. dollar-denominated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion. We used the remaining net proceeds from the offering to prefund certain 2022 debt maturities and for general corporate purposes. In addition
 in September 2021
 we issued euro-denominated notes consisting of €600.0 million of 0.50 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2033
 with interest to be paid annually. The net proceeds from the offering will be used to fund
 in whole or in part
 eligible projects designed to advance one or more of our environmental
 social
 and governance objectives. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
As of December 31
 2021
 we had a total of $5.26 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities
 $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any short-term borrowing needs.
For the 136
th
consecutive year
 we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $3.40 per share and $2.96 per share were paid in 2021 and 2020
 respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2021
 effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2022
 the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.98 per share
 resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2022 of $3.92 per share.
Capital expenditures of $1.31 billion during 2021
 compared to $1.39 billion in 2020.
In 2021
 we repurchased $1.00 billion of shares
 which completed our $8.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. Additionally
 our board authorized a $5.00 billion share repurchase program in May 2021. In 2021
 we repurchased $250.0 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31
 2021
 we had $4.75 billion remaining under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
"See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection."
Both domestically and abroad
 we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers
 including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels.
In the normal course of business
 our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates
 currency values
 and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing
 investing
 and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.
Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures
 we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31
 2021
 substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 13 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31
 2021 and 2020
 including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments
 a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31
 2021 and 2020
 respectively
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.

""
Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates
 primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro
 Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro
 the Japanese yen
 and Chinese yuan). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset
 in part
 the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31
 2021 and 2020
 would not have a material impact on earnings
 cash flows
 or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.
Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31
 2021 and 2020
 our carrying values of these investments were $1.83 billion and $2.04 billion
 respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net
 (income) expense by $365.6 million and $407.6 million as of December 31
 2021 and 2020
 respectively.
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures
 or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g.
 approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement
 we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained.
Individually
 these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However
 if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period
 the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows
 respectively
 in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product
 which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however
 we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that
 from a business perspective
 we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses
 and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex
 and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make
 it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that
 given current facts and circumstances
 it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations
 financial position
 or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Return
 Rebate
 and Discount Accruals
We recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts
 product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers
 provisions for returns
 rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer
 we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 chargeback
 and patient assistance programs in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount
 we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g.
 patent expiries and product launches)
 an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs
 the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs
 and our product pricing.
Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return
 rebate
 and discount accruals.
Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration
 as well as royalties
 upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.
Financial Statement Impact
We believe that our accruals for sales returns
 rebates
 and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31
 2021
 a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability would have led to an approximate $366 million effect on our income before income taxes.
The portion of our consolidated sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31
 2021 and 2020.
The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return
 rebate
 and discount liability balances
 including managed care
 Medicare
 Medicaid
 chargeback
 and patient assistance programs:

Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies
Background and Uncertainties
Litigation liabilities and other contingencies are
 by their nature
 uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation
 the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters
 the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation
 as applicable
 and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions
 if any. In addition
 we accrue for certain liability claims incurred
 but not filed
 to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.
We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage
 we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions
 the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company
 the financial condition of the insurers
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance
 we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage
 we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights
 these considerations include the nature of the indemnification
 the financial condition of the indemnifying party
 and the possibility of and length of time for collection.
The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets
 respectively
 on our consolidated balance sheets.
Acquisitions
Background and Uncertainties
To determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition
 we make certain judgments
 which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules.
If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets
 where applicable
 is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business
 the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and
 therefore
 any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date
 and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
 as well as estimated asset lives
 can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets
 including acquired IPR&D
 are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include
 but are not limited to
 probability of technical success
 revenue growth and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances
 we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.
"The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis
 as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments
 including
 but not limited to
 probability of technical success and the discount rate.
Financial Statement Impact
As of December 31
 2021
 a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $3.5 million.

Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets
Background and Uncertainties
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified
 a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value
 and the cost basis is adjusted.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually
 or more frequently if impairment indicators are present
 by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount
 a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.
Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D
" all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the ""income method"
""" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements."
For acquired IPR&D assets
 the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product
" as discussed previously in ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such"
 it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.
Estimates of future cash flows
 based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections
 require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
Retirement Benefits Assumptions
Background and Uncertainties
Defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate
 expected return on plan assets
 and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below
 see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.
Annually
 we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined
 plan-specific yield curve of high quality
 fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets
 we consider many factors
 with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions
 asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 75 percent of which are growth investments)
 and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results
 as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies
 where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption
 we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.
Annually
 we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively
 alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty
 adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values
 discounted cash flows valuations
 comparable market valuations
 and adjustments for currency
 credit
 liquidity and other risks.

Financial Statement Impact
If the 2021 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by $21.6 million. If the 2021 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point
 income before income taxes would change by $31.5 million. If our assumption regarding the 2021 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year
 our income before income taxes would be affected by $51.1 million. The U.S. plans
 including Puerto Rico
 represent approximately 80 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31
 2021.
Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred
 along with other actuarial gains and losses
 and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.
Income Taxes
Background and Uncertainties
We prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations
 and we record estimates based upon these interpretations. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities
 which could result in future tax
 interest
 and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example
 adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law
 the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities
 new information obtained during a tax examination
 or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets
 primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses
 tax credits
 and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets
 we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.
Financial Statement Impact
As of December 31
 2021
 a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $84.9 million and $43.8 million
 respectively.
