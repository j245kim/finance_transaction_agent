In some circumstances', ' we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses', ' solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult', ' time-consuming and costly', ' and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures.', 'For example', ' on October 26', ' 2020', ' we', ' along with a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ours', ' entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Xilinx', ' Inc. (Xilinx)', ' whereby we agreed to acquire Xilinx (the Merger). We entered into the Merger Agreement with the belief that the Merger will result in certain benefits', ' including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies', ' and drive product innovations. Achieving these anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and Xilinx’s businesses together. It is not certain that Xilinx’s business can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all', ' or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons', ' including', ' but not limited to: failure to obtain applicable regulatory approval in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the Merger; our inability to integrate or benefit from Xilinx’s acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other resources', ' including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the Merger; failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the Merger on our relationships with employees', ' vendors', ' suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with', ' or the loss of', ' Xilinx’s employees', ' vendors', ' suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and Xilinx operate; potential litigation associated with the Merger; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and Xilinx’s financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs', ' decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention', ' which could materially impact the combined company. In addition', ' even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully', ' the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all.

If we cannot successfully integrate our and Xilinx’s businesses and operations', ' or if there are delays in combining the businesses', ' it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business', ' which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.', '30', '30', '30', '', '', 'Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently', ' we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures', ' which could harm our operating results. In addition', ' to complete an acquisition (and as contemplated in the Merger)', ' we may issue equity securities', ' which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock', ' and/or incur debt', ' assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets', ' which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover', ' if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing', ' we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture', ' we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business', ' technologies', ' solutions', ' assets', ' personnel or operations', ' particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us.', 'Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses', ' which could harm our business. Also', ' any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered.

For example', ' we may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance', ' including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property.
